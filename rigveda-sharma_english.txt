Veda Bhashya by Prof. Tulsiram — A step to make
Vedas available to the English World


I have had the privilege of going through some of the
chapters of Yajurveda Bhashya written by Prof. Tulsiram, a
well known Vedic scholar and author of English language
and literature. I congratulate him because he has done this
translation for an average English reader who is keen to know
the Vedas. Knowledge of the Vedas is like the knowledge of
science. Vedic language is a scientific language and nobody
can understand that without the profound knowledge of
Vedangas, especially Nirukta of Maharshi Yaska and the
grammar of Panini and Patanjali. Nobody can interpret the
Veda mantras without these two. This translation proves that
Prof. Tulsiram has done this insightful translation after doing
hard work in both Vedangas.


In translating the Vedas, only literal meaning is just
not sufficient, sometimes it may create confusion and
Vedic Mantras, thinking deeply about words, derivatives and
analyzes the hidden nuances of meaning in their context. For
23’: If we take literal meaning in the ordinary sense, “may
the waters, vital forces of life, and herbs be friendly to us
and may they be enemies to those who hate us and whom we
questions, he says, “How can we accept this?” So, after going
deeply into the words and context he gives this meaning of
the said mantra: May waters, tonics, pranic energies and
medicinal herbs be good friends of our health system and
immunity and let the same waters, tonics, pranic energies
herbal medicines act against those ailments, diseases and


( xiv )


negativities which injure us, which we hate to suffer and
which we love to destroy, moreover let them have no side
effects because side effects too help the negativities and


After giving the actual sense of the Mantra he writes
that this Mantra is a reasonable prayer for the health
programme of an advanced society, and then, logically in
the next Mantra, follows the prayer for a full hundred years
and more of life and healthy living (Tacchakshurdevahitam


The translation by Prof. Tulsiram is without any
extraneous motive and without any extra-academic intention.
The translation has been done purely as communication of
the Vedic message for the welfare of mankind.


While giving his opinion on the Vedas Prof. Tulsiram
writes in his Introduction. ...Veda is the Voice of God revealed
in scientific Vedic Sanskrit free from local color and historical
facts, therefore Vedic language is to be interpreted and
understood according to its own laws and structure, and the
only key available for such interpretation is the Nirukta of
Maharshi Yaska and the grammar of Panini & Patanjali.
According to Maharshi Dayananda Saraswati, ‘without
reference to these bases of Vedic interpretation certain words
have been given a distorted meaning in the translations of
Max Muller, Griffith, Whitney and even Sayana.’ Actually
the torch light for proper translation today, as Aurobindo
says, is the Arsha tradition followed by Maharshi


At the end I will say that this translation of Yajurveda,
based on Nirukta and Grammar, follows the known ancient
Indian tradition. It is factual, without prejudice or hidden
motive. Prof. Tulsiram thinks deeply on every word of the


(xv )


mantra, looks into the context and etymology according to
Nirukta and then does the translation. I congratulate him on
this one more pioneering step to make the knowledge of
Vedas available to the western world and the average English
knowing reader. May God give him long and healthy life so
that he continues to do this kind of stupendous work.

English translation of the Rgveda


I feel myself fortunate and blest with the Grace of
God that I received a few pages of the English translation by
Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma with introduction of the Yajurveda.
The comparative views expressed by him about the Vedas
are essential for every student of the Veda since it is a further
pointer to scientific research in the field of Vedic


Its conclusion is true: “In short Veda is an eternal
articulation of omniscience, the voice of God”. Each work
of Prasthana Trayi i.e. Vedanta, Upanishads and Gita is not a
take off from the Vedas but a continuation of Vedic studies
in its own context of meditation, meditative teaching and a
rousing call to action in a situation of karmic crisis. This
English translation is a welcome addition to Vedic studies
opening truly a new path establishing with ease the Vedas in
the service of humanity.

English Translation of Vedic Hymns: An Opinion


Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma has taken an uphill task of
translating all the four Vedas in lucid and thought provoking
English. Most of the translations of Vedas by European
scholars depend on the ritualistic meaning given by the
medieval commentators like Sayana and others. But Dr.
Sharma has taken a new course of translation. He agrees with
the idea that the Yajurveda basically propounds the theory of
Karma which it explains as Yajna, which neither denotes
sacrifice nor mere ritual (Agnihotra etc.). The term Yajna
carries a threefold meaning: the worship of God, unification
of diverse factors of human society, selfless charity and
replenishment of nature and the environment.


The hymns of the Yajurveda carry lofty ideas of
spiritual and ethical significance. Most of these mantras are,
however, complicated and tough. It is difficult to make out
useful meaning and draw important conclusion out of the
text. But Dr. Sharma has fully succeeded in drawing out the
natural and meaningful content of these mantras. In brief I
can say that the present translation of the Vedas will be
appreciated by the scholars of this Vedic lore as well as by
the lay man who wants to understand the deep meaning of
the Vedic texts or at least the basic knowledge hidden in these
ancient works. It is all the more satisfying that Dr. Sharma
has followed the dicta laid down by Maharshi Yaska and
Swami Dayananda Saraswati in translating and explaining
the inner wisdom of the sacred mantras.

AUM


It has been gratifying to go through the English
translation of the Vedas rendered by Dr Tulsi Ram Sharma
in as much as it conveys to the English-knowing world
effectively the profound meaning and transcendental secrets
enshrined in the Vedas. The most salient feature of this
translation is its simple and lucid English. The Vedic words
have been expounded here following the yaugik method of
the Arsh tradition set up by Yaska, Panini and Patanjali (as
opposed to the rudhi method which takes only the historically
fixed meanings of words caring little for the context and the
subject). As per the Arsh tradition name words like Agni,
Vayu, Indra, Marut, etc., are synonyms indicating the various
attributive names of the One that is the greatest and the most
comprehensive “Tattva’ of existence, the Cosmic Spirit. It
was Maharshi Dayananda who for the first time after Yaska
and Patanjali advocated and followed this principle of
interpretation on the basis of ancient supporting material.
Dr. Sharma has religiously stuck to this theory while
unfolding the truths enshrined in the Vedas. Obviously Dr
Sharma’s interpretation of Vedic hymns enjoys the
authenticity of the Arsh tradition and challenges the western
Vedic perspective and the medieval Indian interpretations of
the Vedas which now need to be seriously reviewed in our
present day context of science and inter-cultural

Above the narrow boundaries of country, time, caste
and creed, the Vedas have been a treasure house of eternal
universal knowledge and spiritual wisdom. There have been
numerous attempts by Indians and foreigners to make the
knowledge of these Vedas available to the people at large.
Among them the Vedic commentaries of the great social and
spiritual leader, Maharshi Dayananda are the best works in
this field. Inspired by Swami Dayananda, the translation of
the Yajurveda into English by Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma is a
commendable work in this line. Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma has
been a great devotee of sacred literature, especially Vedas,
Upanishads, and various philosophies. His life long study of
the Vedas has given him deep insight into Vedic philosophy.
His translation of the Yajurveda reveals it fully. Here he has
translated the Yajurveda, the Veda of Karma, in such a way
that even a common reader can grasp its essence. He has
very effectively brought out how this Veda teaches us to apply
spiritual knowledge in practical life. Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma
deserves our congratulations and best wishes for having done
translation of all the four Vedas in simple and clear English
for the international community.





(xx )


I have gone through some chapters of the English
translation of Yajurveda by Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma. As he has
stated at the very beginning of the Introduction, this
translation of Yajurveda is meant for an average English-
knowing reader who is keen to know: What is Veda? What is
it about? Is it old or new? To achieve this object, he has
followed the Arsh method of interpretation. Accordingly, for
example, he has mostly followed the etymological method
of literal translation. But whenever he finds that the literal is
not helpful in achieving his intended objective, he adds the
implied explanation so that the essence of the Vedic hymn is
quite clear. For example, his translation of, ‘Yathemam
Vacham Kalyanimavadani janebhyah’ is rendered as
follows—‘Just as I speak (reveal) this auspicious holy Word
of the Veda for all people (without discrimination of high or
low), so should you too communicate it to all people of the
world, whosoever, whatsoever, where so ever they be’. That
is the technique of Swami Dayananda also.


I regard Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma as one in the
commendable line of Pundit Damodar Satavalekara who
studied Sanskrit at a mature age and did unique work in that
language. Dr. Sharma has also mastered the Sanskrit language
after his retirement and done full justice to the translation of
the Veda. He richly deserves our gratefulness, our expression
of gratification and our appreciation for succeeding in his
sacred mission of presenting an understandable, logical and
above all sensible English translation of Vedas which hitherto
was unavailable. Thus a long felt need has been fulfilled. I
am sure Dr Sharma’s method of translation will not only be
widely approved but will also be followed by others while
translating the Vedas in other languages.

Dr. Tulsi Ram Sharma, is a profound scholar of English,
Hindi, Sanskrit and Urdu. But his heart felt devotion goes to sacred
Puranas, Ramayana, and Mahabharata with concentration on the
Bhagwad Gita, Greek, Roman, Sumerian and English Epics,
Gathas of Zarathustra, Bible, Quran and the writings of Swami
Dayananda and Swami Vivekananda, in search of the essential
values of Veda and Sanatan Vedic Dharma. It seems his real spirit
and scholarly interest lies in the interpretation of the Vedas. I
have gone through some portions of his English translation of
Yajurveda and on perusal of this translation, I have marked two

is knowledge of existence, pure and simple, as Science is
knowledge. Science is the knowledge of nature as nature is and
as it works according to its own laws. In Science, there is no
story, no history. Similarly, in the Vedas, there is no story, no
history. And just as Science is knowledge in Scientific language,
free from local colour and historical variations of form and
meaning, so Veda too is knowledge in scientific language, free
from local colour and historical variations.”

Veda is ‘Knowledge’ and knowledge is eternal. The
interpretation of the Vedas requires the knowledge of the Arsh
technique as explained by the Rshis like Yaska, Panini, Patanjali,
Dayananda and Aurobindo.

As Veda is pure knowledge, so is this translation in theArsh
tradition, free from myth and history with no local colour, no
attitude, no motive, except pure communication of the Original
for all.


With best wishes to the author and specially to the readers,


Formerly Professor of Economics,


To the Reader


This translation of the ‘Hymns of Yajurveda’ is an English
Version of the Yajurveda for the common reader who wants to
acquaint himself or herself with the content of this divine message
of the dynamics of Karma, both human and divine, in the context
of the nature, structure and purpose of the universe and the
condition and position of the human being in it. While the opening
mantra launches the human being on life with the exhortation:
“Be vibrant as the winds’, the closing mantra seals the success of
vibrant humanity in action with the final achievement of “Om
Kham Brahma” with Grace Divine.


Life according to the Yajurveda is a journey from the
beginning-less beginning to the endless end with the message:


Immortal child of Divinity,

Your roots go deep to Eternity,
Your reach is unto Infinity.

And your path is up and onwards,


This version is a scientific translation of the text within
the parameters of Yaska and Dayananda with rational
understanding of Sayana at the one end and the western scholars
at the other. Sayana’s translation is ritualistic especially with
reference to yajna. It came at a time when the “Renaissance, Re-
awakening of Learning” was far off, not yet just at the next door.
Even communication between the East and the West was not as
hectic as it became after the advent of the East India Company
into India. Thus mutual criticism and appreciation too was silent
rather than vocal. Hence Ritualism was just the thing acceptable
to a society settled on the side of stagnation more than of


Ritual, of course, is sacred. It is the most meticulous
programme of action in pursuit of a holistic plan of life and living
which arises from a spiritual vision of Divinity. It is conducted
with unreserved commitment of will in faultless action, and
completed with total surrender in absolute faith. For this reason


( Xxlil )

yajna in Veda and Upanishad, is described as the highest human
action, “Shreshthatamam karma”. This view is accepted in this
translation too. But in addition, an extended interpretation of the
same view of yajna is incorporated and followed in the light of
Swami Dayananda, and also as warranted by the exhortation in
the opening mantra: “Apply yourself to the highest form of action,
yajna, in the service of Indra, lord of the universe, for the glory of
the human 18110117". The highest actions in the world of existence,
the creative evolution of the universe under the immanent
presiding presence of Divinity, and the total corporate action of
humanity for progress, peace and freedom, all this is yajna. And
this idea leads us to discover for ourselves and understand the
science, art and technology of participative living for progress,
from the individual level, through the social, to the cosmic, as
universal Yajna, human, natural and divine.


There may or may not be an escape from Sayana, but there
is no possible escape from Dayananda, and even from westerners
especially for the sake of caution and self correction.


I respect the western translators for their clarity and their
art of communication. In addition, I find that they did recognise
that the ideal way to interpret and explain the Sanskrit words of
Indian scriptures such as Vedas was to trace back every word to
its root, deconstruct and reconstruct it with the addition of the
affixes, and then structurally explain its meaning. That precisely
was the approach of Yaska, Panini, Patanjali and Swami
Dayananda. Monier Williams, author of the well known Sanskrit
English Dictionary, himself admired the Indians for their scientific
approach to language, specially Sanskrit:


“TI draw attention at the very threshold to the fact that
the Hindus are perhaps the only nation, except for the Greeks,
who have investigated, independently and in a truly scientific
manner, the general laws which govern the evolution of


He continues in relation to Sanskrit: “The synthetical
process which comes into operation in the working of those laws
may be well called Samskarana, ‘putting together’, by which I
mean that every single word in the highest type of language (called


( Xxiv )


Sanskrita) is first evolved out of a primary ‘Dhatu’—a Sanskrit
term usually translated as ‘Root’, but applicable to any primordial
constituent substance, whether of words, or rocks, or living
organisms, and then, being so evolved, goes through a process of
‘putting together’ by the combination of other elementary
of the evolution, structure and dynamics of the world of reality,
and Veda as articulation of the reality of existence. |


“Furthermore, the process of ‘putting together’ implies,
of course, the possibility of a converse process of vyakarana. by
which I mean ‘undoing’ or decomposition (deconstruction), that
is to say, the resolution of every root-evolved word into its
component elements. So that in endeavouring to exhibit these
processes of synthesis and analysis, we appear to be engaged,
like a chemist, in combining elementary substances into solid
forms, and again in resolving these forms into their constituent
ingredients.” (p. xii). And in respect of this special character,
Sanskrit, he says, is a different language from the Semitic
languages (of which the Bible and the Quran are expressions).


And yet, in spite of this clear understanding of Sanskrit,
an Arsha dictionary remained with him only “a beautiful
philological dream, a dream, however, which could not receive
practical shape without raising the Lexicon to a level of scientific
perfection unsuited to the needs of ordinary students.” (p. x1i1)


Why unsuited? The answer lies in his mission and the
main object of his mission. The scientific way of interpretation
and explanation was counter to the purpose for which Monier
Williams was appointed Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford where
he occupied the Boden Chair after H.LH.Wilson who had been a
member of the Committee of Public Instruction in India under
Lord Macaulay as Chairman and Lord William Bentinck as
Governor General of India. And then English had been accepted
and introduced as the medium as well as the content of Education.


Monier Williams says: “One consideration which led my
predecessor (Professor H.H.Wilson) to pass on to me his project
of a root-arranged Lexicon was that, on being elected to the Boden
Chair, he felt that the elaboration of such a work would be


( xxv )


incompatible with the practical objects for which the Boden
Professorship was founded. . . The main object was really a
missionary one, as I have shown in the Preface of this volume.”
(p. Xi)

The object, Professor Williams explains in the Preface to
his Dictionary (p. 1x): “I must draw attention to the fact that I am
only the second occupant of the Boden Chair, and that its founder,
Colonel Boden, stated most explicitly in his will (dated August
15, 1811) that the special object of his munificent bequest was to
promote the translation of the Scriptures (that is, the Bible) into
Sanskrit, so as ‘to enable his countrymen to proceed in the
conversion of the natives of India to the Christian Religion’.


following in the footsteps of my venerated master, I have made
it the chief aim of my professional life to provide facilities for
the translation of our sacred Scriptures into Sanskrit, and
for the promotion of a better knowledge of the religions and
customs of India as the best way to a knowledge of the religious
needs of our great Eastern Dependency (India). My very first
public lecture delivered after my election (to the Boden Chair)
in 1860 was on ‘The Study of Sanskrit in Relation to
Missionary Work in India’ (published in 1861)’’. (pp. xxi)


For any student of Veda, specially in India, in fact
anywhere, it is difficult to overlook the words of Monier Williams
in the Preface and Introduction to his Dictionary of Sanskrit, for
the reason that from translation of Christian Scriptures into
Sanskrit with a missionary motive, the translation of Sanskrit
Scriptures into English was but the next and ‘logical’ step
with that same missionary motive of conversion, one to extol,
the other to denigrate:


One example, of extolment, is the following translation
of the Bible, “The Gospel according to John’:




Jesus here is presented as an Avatara, someone a very God
for the traditional Hindu, although the Gospel does not mention
the incarnation at all. (The translation of The Bible in Sanskrit by


( 1)
J.Wenger is available on the internet.)


The other example, of denigration, is given here below
from W.D. Whitney’s translation of the Atharvaveda (7, 107, 1)
edited and revised by K.L. Joshi, published by Parimal




“Having paid homage to heaven and earth, to the
atmosphere, to Death, I will urinate standing erect; let not the


I give below an English rendering of the same mantra
translated by Pundit Satavalekara in Hindi:


“Having done homage to heaven and earth and to the
middle regions and Death (Yama), I stand high and watch (the
world of life). Let not my masters hurt me.”


An English rendering of the same mantra translated by
Pundit Jai Dev Sharma in Hindi is the following:


“Having done homage to heaven and earth (i.e. father and
mother) and to the immanent God and Yama (all Dissolver),
standing high and alert, I move forward in life. These masters of


I would like to quote my own translation of the mantra


“Having done homage to heaven and earth, and to the
middle regions, and having acknowledged the fact of death as
inevitable counterpart of life under God’s dispensation, now
standing high, I watch the world and go forward with showers of
the cloud. Let no powers of earthly nature hurt and violate me.”


‘Showers of the cloud’ is a metaphor, as in Shelley’s poem
‘the Cloud’: “I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers”,
which suggests a lovely rendering.


The problem here arises from the verb ‘mekshami’ from
the root ‘mih’ which means ‘to shower’ (sechane). It depends on
the translator’s sense and attitude to sacred writing how the
message is received and communicated in an interfaith context


( 3311 )
with no strings attached (or unattached).


This extolment and denigration was happening around
the time when the English language, English education and
missionary work had been introduced into India and was raging
on top. Swami Dayananda faced this challenge with boldness and
caution, still with an open mind, all prepared even for correction.
He based his interpretation of the Vedas on Nirukta and the
etymological principles of word interpretation, and interpretation
of the word in the context, both local and total, because the local
is an integral part of the total whole.


We are living in an age of science and reason, democracy
and freedom, globalism and global communication, and we feel
the need for a free and frank interfaith dialogue. In such an age,
ritualism and mythology is not enough. If we want to understand
and present Veda as a body of universal knowledge and articulation
of divine awareness of existence, there is no escape from Yaska,
Panini, Patanjali, Dayananda and Aurobindo, because they provide
the key principles and practice of scientific interpretation of an
ancient scientific language such as Vedic Sanskrit which has no
historical parallel for comparison. The language of science tells
no stories, no myths. It states the truth pure and simple. Hence
the resort to Swami Dayananda, either before or after Sayana and
the western scholars, is indispensable.


There is one observation I must make on Swami
orientation to the Vedic mantras because he underscores the
relevance of the Vedas to the social, economic and political
situation of humanity, especially in India, which was necessary
and highly meaningful. For example, the Ashwins, in general,
are the complementary powers of nature and humanity working
as twin forces like the positive and negative currents of electricity,
or like the theoretician and the laboratory man, or the curative
and recuperative powers of medicine and nature’s powers of
rejuvenation. Swami Dayananda often explains such powers in
the interest of practical understanding: he defines them as teacher
and preacher, or father and mother, sun and moon, fire and water,
prana and Apana energy, ruler and council, scientist and engineer,
and so on, depending on the mantra context. Sometimes it appears



as if he is delimiting the open-ended general meaning of the Veda.
But we should be careful before we say so, and realise that the
definiteness of his meaning is illustrative and in no way
exhaustive. In this translation such situations have been
appreciated and the meaning has been kept open ended, inclusive
of the meanings given by Swami Dayananda, as suggested by
Yaska and the etymology of the terms. In short, this translation
has been done with cautious reference to Sayana, under the
guidance of Swami Dayananda, with respect for Pundit
Satavalekara and with very careful observance of the western


Pundit Satavalekara comes in between Sayana and swami
Dayananda for his excellent syntactic structures of mantra
meanings in continuous Hindi. But he explains words such as
etc. as proper names so that the mantra appears to be a mythical
or historical statement of either fact or fiction. But Swami
Dayananda interprets these terms in the yaugic manner and
explains them as scientific terms of the forms, functions, orders
and attributes of the powers of existence representing the
manifestive diversity of one Divinity and one Prakrti in the state
of objective existence. These words are not historical names,
because the time context of the creation of the Vedas remains
unknown beyond history and imagination as even Max Muller
confessed in his Gifford lectures in 1890.


This translation respects the entire tradition of Vedic
interpretation, and under the guidance of this tradition takes Vedic
interpretation to the original level of scientific rationality in the
context of modern consciousness, modern language and global
culture, a message both sanatan and, at the same time, modern


Take just one example of the problem I have faced, with
the solution I have suggested: Yajurveda (36, 23) says, if we take
the literal meaning in the ordinary sense: “May the waters, pranic
energies and herbs be friendly to us and may they be enemies to
those who hate us and whom we hate.” How can we accept this?
How can the same waters, tonics and herbs be good friends to us
and enemies to those we hate or those who hate us? Medicine 1s


( XXIV )


medicine after all. This is excellent stuff for a translator who
believes that Vedic poetry is nothing but the voice of a tribal society
in the barbaric, not civilized, state of social evolution. But let us
think deeply. What is the context? Who are our enemies in that
context? Who or what are those that injure us? What are those
we hate or want to injure and destroy? The context is health. In
the context of health, they are the ailments, diseases, germs and
bacteria, viruses, negativities and side effects of medicines in our
system. So the correct and scientific interpretation in the context
of health would be: “May waters, tonics, pranic energies and
medicinal herbs be good friends of our health and immunity
system and let the waters, tonics, pranic energies and herbal
medicines act against those ailments, diseases and negativities
which injure us, which we hate to suffer and which we love to
effects too aggravate the negativities and injure us.” This is the
reasonable prayer and health programme of an advanced society.
And then, logically in the next mantra, follows the prayer for a

Introduction to Rgveda


This translation of Rgveda is meant for an average
English knowing reader who is keen to know:


What is Veda? What is it all about? Is it old or new?


If it’s old, what is its relevance today? And if it is
relevant, is it relevant to me also? Or is it relevant only to
some particular community in some particular country at


These are relevant questions especially in an age of
science, democracy and globalism.


Veda is Knowledge. The very word ‘Veda’ means
knowledge. It is derived from the root ‘vid’, which means:
‘to be, to know, to think, and to benefit from’.


So whatever is is Veda, the very world of existence
is Veda. The knowledge of the world of existence is Veda.
The extension of knowledge through thought and research
further is Veda. And to use that knowledge for the benefit of
mankind with the protection and preservation of nature and
the environment, without hurting any form of life, that is


Veda is knowledge, pure and simple, as science is
knowledge. Science is knowledge of nature as nature is and
as it works according to its own laws. In science, there is no
story no history. Similarly in the Veda, there is no story, no
history. And just as science is knowledge in scientific
language free from local colour and historical variations of
form and meaning, so Veda too is knowledge in scientific
language free from local colour and historical variations.
Therefore Vedic language has to be interpreted and
understood according to the laws and technique of its own
structure as stated by seers such as Yaska, Panini and Patanjali


( XxXxi )


and as explained by Swami Dayananda in his grammatical
works and his notes on Vedic words in his commentary on
the Vedas.


But there is a difference between scientific
knowledge and Vedic knowledge: While science is
knowledge of nature to the extent that man has been able to
discover it, Veda is the quintessential knowledge of all that
is, including nature, all that happens, all that we are, all that
we do, and all that we reap in consequence of our action. It
is the Original and Universal knowledge of the Reality of
Existence and the Ideality of our aspirations, covering the
facts and processes of existence, their interaction and the
laws that operate in the interaction. In short, Veda is an eternal
articulation of Omniscience, The Voice of God.


Vedic knowledge is classified thematically into three:
Stuti, Prarthana and Upasana. Stuti, praise, is solemn
reverential remembrance and description of the attributes,
nature, character and function of divine powers. Prarthana,
prayer, is an autosuggestive resolution to realise our
limitations and rise above those limitations by calling on
Divinity for aid and blessings when we have exhausted our
effort and potential. Upasana is meditation, the surrender of
our limited identity to participate in the Divine Presence.
and action (Karma), and Upasana implies total love and
surrender (Bhakti). In consequence, formally, Vedic
knowledge is divided into four:

Rgveda is the Veda of Knowledge, Yajurveda is the
Veda of Karma, Samaveda is the Veda of Bhakti, and Atharva-
veda is Brahma Veda, an umbrella, celebrating the Divine
Presence as in Book 10, hymns 7 and 8.

Rgveda is the Veda of knowledge revealed by
Parameshvara, Lord Supreme Himself. All the four Vedas


( Xxxil )


were received by the primeval Rshis from That Supreme
Divinity (Rgveda, 10, 90, 9). That Supreme power and
presence is One and only one, wise sages call it by many
names such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna and others. That
one Lord creates this wonderful world of many forms and
pervades it simultaneously (6, 47, 18). The creative evolution
begins from that and when one cycle is complete, the
involution ends up therein (10, 129, 7). The light of the sun
radiates from there (10, 37, 3), the streams of life flow from
there through the medium of five elements (1, 164, 3). We
too come from there and retire unto That when the existential
sojourn terminates (8, 44, 23), that is the covenant of man
and God. The truth of Vedas is eternal (5, 25, 2). Law is


Our life is a lovely sojourn of our active and
intelligent choice (5, 1, 2; 6, 15, 9) in the fivefold body (5,
47,5), or outside the body (1, 164, 30), in a homely paradise
on earth (6, 120, 3), or in a fools paradise (9, 64, 20-1).
Therefore the one basic commandment of Vedas is “Be man’,
intelligent human being (10, 53, 6), be a visionary which
you ought to be (1, 31, 6), in the category of Deva, godliness
(1, 68, 2), remembering fully well that each one comes alone
for a short time (10, 97, 5), to live in a house of clay (8, 44,
23) which is not our ultimate destination. Therefore our self-
fulfilment lies through breaking the threefold bonds of body,
mind and spiritual ignorance (1, 24, 15), rise beyond the
darkness and reach the light Divine (1, 50, 10). The Light is
our real potential as children of Immortality, unhurt,

Rgveda begins with an invocation and prayer to
Agni, Lord of light and energy, giver of life and light, the
first, original and ultimate High-priest of the yajna of creative
evolution and ends with a prayer to Agni for the gift of the



fragrance and nectar of yajnic life from the vedi of
the earth. It exhorts humanity to live together in creative and
cooperative unity, to act and move together, to speak together,
and to think together for a united decision and common
achievement, knowing each other’s mind in harmony in the
same tradition as the ancient wise followed in the
performance of Dharma.


Rgveda gives a clear picture of the socio-political
and economic organisation of humanity from the local to the
international level. The Vedic word for a brilliant,
enlightened, sovereign republic is Swarajya (3, 49, 2; 3, 46,
1; 3, 45,5; 1, 36, 7). The word for such an organisation is
Rashtra. For such a Rashtra, efforts have to be made (1, 80,9),
there should be three assemblies: the Executive, Legislature,
the Law and Order and Defence forces (3, 38, 6), and the
Educational Authority. The ruler and the assemblies have to
be elected by the people from amongst the educated and
socially dedicated people (Atharva, 3, 4, 2). Yajurveda and
Atharva- Veda provide further details. The Vedic ideal of any
human organisation and its law is that the organisation, in
order to be just, creative, productive and egalitarian, must be


The universe, the social system too, is a Purusha, a
person (10, 90,2) of which the intellectual is the spokesman
of values, of knowledge, rectitude and piety, the law and
order and defence forces are the guards, the produces are
providers, and the ancillary services are assistants, all
governed by law which should be a human version of Rtam,
the law of Nature and Divinity governing the universe.


There are many other Themes as prayers to
Parameshvara, divine attributes of the forces of Nature,
attributes, potential and limitations of the individual soul,


( Xxxiv )


life and death, individual freedom, marriage and family life,
free social mobility under the Verna-Ashrama Dharma based
on merit, precreation stage of existence (10, 129, 1-7) which
was the Zero state which we can describe neither as existence
nor as non-existence: There ‘was’ or, may be, there ‘was not’:


It was the state of Zero Absolute,
The Hour beyond the hour.

Darkness beyond the dark.

Silence, mother of speech,

Void, mother of space and time,
THAT One beyond the name,

The flow consumed in the point of no dimensions


This is Vision beyond the vision of mind, the mystery
of Rgveda.


Between this point of Potential Infinity for creation
and the time of cosmic dissolution there is the evolutionary
and involuntary interplay of natural forces Agni, Indra, Soma,
heaven and earth, and the social dynamics of humanity for
four billion and three hundred and twenty million years, a
drama of infinite variety, ultimately all sucked in into the
mysterious Black Hole, and then the breath out, back again.


So, says Rgveda, be good, do good, and make the


Samaveda is Bhaktiveda in song, a symphony of




Veda mantras chiefly from Rgveda in celebration of the Truth,
Beauty and Goodness of life and the Power, Glory, Sublimity
and Beatitude of Divinity. It begins with an invitation to Agni,
Light and Life of the universe, moves to Indra, the Power
and Glory of Divinity and then to Beatific Soma, divine Spirit
of peace and universal joy, and ends with thanks and prayer
to All-listening Indra, All-embracing Pusha, inviolable
Tarkshya, and Brhaspati, Lord of Infinity, for the gifts of
peace, progress, prosperity and total well being.


Yajurveda is Karma Veda, knowledge of the
application of knowledge in practical living in a positive,
creative and constructive manner at both the individual and
the collective level. This way of living and working is “Yajna”’
which, in simple words, means a selfless and participative
way of living and thereby creating the maximum out of the
minimum for all, including nature, humanity, the environment
and the whole universe, with complete faith in the living,
Sovereign System. Living the yajnic way, we realise that
Nature is an organisn, a tree, Ashwattha, and the entire cosmos
including ourselves is a Purusha, and we as human beings
are but cells in this Divine Purusha. Without living this way
in a state of full awareness, we cannot realise that you and I,
Mother Nature and the Supreme Brahma are all together,
one in union and communion.


Vedic knowledge then is the Divine knowledge of
existence from the dimensionless point and particle unto
Infinity. And prayerful living and communion in meditation
and yoga means: Self-integration of the particle, Re-
integration of the part with the whole, and Re-Union of the
finite with the Infinite.


This is the climactic close of Yajurveda: The light
and life that shines in and beyond the sun is that Supreme


( XXXvi )


Purusha. That is there, and that is here, in me too.


Om is the saviour. Om is Bramha. Bramha is Infinite,


The message of Yajurveda begins with the rousing
divine call to live: “Be vibrant as the winds!” But we must
be gratefully vibrant: “O Lord we pray for and thank thee for
the gift of food and energy for life, for the health and
efficiency of body, mind and soul.” All of us must dedicate
ourselves to Savita, giver of life and light, with devotion to
the highest, yajnic, action, we must not hurt the ‘Cow’, and
we must not allow a thief to boss over us and deprive us of
our creative freedom of thought, word and deed.


Atharva- Veda is Brahma Veda, umbrella knowledge
of existence both Murtta and Amurtta, concrete and abstract.
It is the knowledge of Prakrti, Mother Nature, as well as of
Purusha, the Soul, the individual Jiva as well as the Cosmic
Soul Brahma. It begins with a celebrative description of the
thrice-seven variant evolutes of Prakrti and a prayer to
Vachaspati, Lord of Nature and the Word of Knowledge, to
bless us with strength, energy, intelligence and knowledge
emanating from those thrice-seven forms of the world of
Nature and Spirit. It covers the world of humanity from the
individual to the total collective personality of humanity,
including social structures from the family, community and
the nation up to the international United Nations. It pays
homage to Divinity, Jyeshtha Brahma, Supreme Presiding
Spirit and Power, immanent and transcendent, which creates
and sustains and winds up the world of existence in each
cycle of creation, eternally (10, 7-8, and 19, 6). Towards the
end Atharva-Veda pays homage to Brahma and Mother Veda
with thanks for the gifts of good health and full age, vibrant
achievement and divine lustre of life. These are the gifts of


( XXXvil )


Vedic knowledge in life, and when one cycle of
existence reaches the hour of completion, the Mother
Knowledge returns to her eternal and Original abode,
Jyeshtha Brahma Itself, the mighty, mysterious, awful Silence,
impenetrable Darkness, Smaller than the smallest
conceivable, yet Greater than the greatest imaginable, the
Original and Ultimate Home of all that matter, energy, thought
and Speech is, beyond time and space.


As you open the text of Rg- Veda, you find the words:
Agni, Madhucchanda Rshi. ‘Devata’ here means the subject
which is dealt with in the mantra. ‘Devata’ as a Vedic term
means a presence, a power, a force, which is brilliant,
illuminative, and generous. The “Devata’ of a mantra may
be God, the One Sacchidananda Brahma as in the closing
mantra quoted above, or Savita, the same One self-refulgent
God as in the opening mantra of Yajurveda, or it can be a
generous divine power of Nature such as the sun, moon, earth;
or it can be a noble person of brilliant quality of nature,
character and performance as a ruler, leader, commander,
teacher, etc. What the ‘Devata’ means in any particular mantra
depends on the total context that emerges from the mantra in
its thematic environment of the hymn.


Madhucchanda is the Rshi of the opening mantra.
The Rshi in the Arsha tradition is not the author of the mantra,
Rshi is the exponent of the meaning of the mantra. As
Maharshi Yaska says in the Nirukta, Rshis are the ‘seers of
the mantras: they are the sages who went into deep meditation
unto the universal frequency of the Cosmic Mind and
experienced the voice of Divinity speaking in the mantra,
the mantra, a semantic correspondence of the Divine Voice,
the Divine Voice, a sound correspondence of Divine
Awareness of the Reality of Existence in the modes of Being
and Becoming.


( XXXVili )

Who then is the poet of the Vedas? The answer is in
Yajurveda 40, 8: That Cosmic Spirit which pervades and rules
every moving particle in the moving universe is “the poet,
thinker, all-comprehending, and self-existent”. That is the
Lord who creates the world of existence, ordains the Laws
of its dynamics, and reveals the poetry of its beauty and
majesty, the Vedas. “From that Lord of universal yajna were
born the Rks and Samans. From Him were born the Chhandas
of Atharva-veda and from Him were born the Yajus”,
(Yajurveda 31, 7). The Vedic lore comes in Pura-kalpa, the
beginning of the world of humanity (Shvetashvataropanishad,
6, 22) and when its function is over at the end of the kalpa,
one cycle of existence, it retires into Brahma-loka (Atharva-
veda 19, 71, 1).


The Vedas were revealed by the Lord Omniscient to
four primeval Rshis: Rgveda to Agni, Yajurveda to Vayu,
Samaveda to Aditya, and Atharva-veda to Angira, directly in
their spiritual consciousness. The Sage Brahma received and
collected the four from them and passed them on to other
sages.


When were the Vedas revealed? What is their age?
How old are they? As old as the age of humanity on earth.
The Lord who creates humanity leaves them not to nature
like animals. He enlightens them with the knowledge of
existence and their place in the world with the vision of their
journey and its culmination. Swami Dayananda works out
the age of the Vedas on the basis of Surya Siddhanta which
in the year 2010 A.D. comes to 1,96,08,53,110 years.


If someone does not accept it and insists on historical
proof, let us listen to Max Muller from whom we learn of
the problem of the date or dates but with no possibility of
solution on scientific and historical grounds.


Max Muller is known as a world renowned Vedic


( XXX1x )


scholar and exegesist of the West. Max Muller once ventured
to pronounce a purely arbitrary date based on unproven
assumptions that around 1200 B.C. was the date of the
Rgveda. Later, he himself warned his students that “Whether
the Vedic Hymns were composed in 1000 or 1500 or 2000
B.C., no power on earth could ever fix .... Whatever may be
the date of the Vedic hymns... they have their own unique
place and stand by themselves”. Such daring presumptions
of western scholars about the date of the Vedas are exposed
by Graham Hancock in his latest researches, in his explosive
book: Underworld: The Mysterious Origins of Civilization
(2002).


Hancock first gives the range of dates accepted by
Western scholars such as Max Muller and Dr. Mitchiner, a
“Amazing!” says he: “Whether starting in 1500 BC, 1400
BC or 1200 BC, the timelines, suggested for the compilation
and codification of the Vedas, all rest on the now thoroughly
falsified and bankrupt (and rejected) idea of an Aryan
invasion of India around 1500 BC”. He continues: “There
was no such thing as an Aryan race that spoke Indo —European
languages and authored the Vedas, there was no such event
as an Aryan invasion of India. ‘Arya’ does not mean a race,
it means a noble, educated and cultured person. So once the
hypothesis of the Aryan invasion is rejected, the structure of
the supposed dates of the Vedas and other texts crumbles
like a house of cards.’ And then he sums up his view of the
Western approach to the Vedas and Indian civilization:
“Almost everything that was ever written about this literature
and civilization before five years ago (i.e., before 1997) is


(xl)


Max Muller himself in his Gifford Lectures in 1890
had confessed that “no power on earth could ever fix” the
date of the Vedas. Even Mitchiner himself concedes that “the
dating of Sanskrit texts is a notoriously difficult problem”
(Quoted Ibid p. 131).


Who could then possibly speak the truth about
ancient Indian civilisation and the Vedic literature? Says
Hancock (p. 105): “Perhaps we are coming to a time when
ancient India will speak for herself again after millennia of
silence.” It was Swami Dayananda who spoke for India and
the Vedas in the Rshis’ tradition after millennia of silence to
correct the distortions of Indian history and redeem Vedic
literature and the Vedic tradition.


help, better follow the sages tradition, Surya Siddhanta, and
the daily sankalpa of the dedicated Brahmanas. And lastly
follow the internal evidence of the Vedas themselves: Vedas
are the Original, Universal, Eternal articulation of Divinity,
by Divinity, for humanity at the beginning of human creation.


Since Vedas are the oldest recorded knowledge of
the world, no one can guess how much time, even ages, might
have passed between the Vedas and the next work in Sanskrit.
If so, there is no other work in Sanskrit comparable to the
Vedas. Consequently the language of any other work would
not provide any clue for the interpretation of Veda mantras.
Vedic language then has to be interpreted on its own, and the
only key available for such independent interpretation is the
Nirukta and Nighantu of Maharshi Yaska, the grammatical
works of Panini and Patanjali, and Swami Dayananda’s notes
in his commentary on Vedic verses explaining the structure
and meaning of the words. Without reference to these bases
of Vedic interpretation, certain words have been given a very


( xli )


distorted meaning in other translations by Max
Muller, Griffith, Whitney, and even Sayana. The torch light
for proper translation today is the Arsha tradition followed
by Swami Dayananda.


The Arsha way is the only right way, the key, to
discover the truth of the Vedas. According to Shri Aurobindo,
Swami Dayananda alone, in modern times, possessed this
key to the secret of the Vedas. Interpreted this way the Vedas
shine in their essential scientific refulgence. As science is
pure knowledge, no story, no history, no mythology, so are
the Vedas, pure knowledge: knowledge of nature, mind, spirit,
human society, Dharma, the dynamics of existence and the
right way of living as individuals and as members of
organised society upto the international level. Even Max
Muller, though he was once committed to uprooting the
religion of India by his arbitrary translation of Rgveda, had
to admit in his Biographical Essays that: “To Swami
Dayananda, everything contained in the Vedas was not only
perfect truth, but he went one step further and, by their
interpretation, succeeded in persuading others that everything
worth knowing, even the most recent inventions of modern
science, were alluded to in the Vedas. Steam Engines,
Electricity, Telegraphy and Wireless Marconogram were
shown to have been at least in the germ known to the poets
of the Vedas”. In fact Shri Aurobindo in his essay on
“Dayananda and the Veda” goes even further: “There is
nothing fantastic in Dayananda’s idea that Veda contains truth
of science as well as truth of religion (i.e., Dharma). I will
even add my own conviction that Veda contains other truths
of a Science the modern world does not at all possess, and in
that case, Dayananda has rather understated than overstated
the depth and range of the Vedic wisdom (see ‘Bankim, Tilak,


(>)

The basic requirement of scriptural interpretation for
us is faith and intellingetial solemnity, not doubt and cynicism.
This way, if we want to confirm our faith in the scientific
vision of the Veda, refer to Rgveda 1, 34, 7 and 9 for three-
stage rocket chariot of the Ashwins, to 1, 36, 18 for Agni
missile, to 1, 37, 3 for winds and communication, to 1, 46,
10 for concentration of light, to 1, 52, 1 and 1, 36, 1 for the
science of missile defence and space-craft, to 6, 46, 11 for
missiles and war heads, and so on. The position of the solar
system with planets and satellites, earth’s and sun’s
organisational structure of the nation and the international
world, water and electric energy, and so many other subjects
are hinted at in Vedic verses. We need serious research to
work out the details. Had even Einstein read the Purusha
Sukta of the Vedas, Brahma Sutras and Sankhya Vaisheshika
philosophy, probably he would have found clues to his search
for Unified Field theory of the universe.


Beyond faith and intelligential solemnity we need
vision, potential Darshan of the Vedic Rshis. Once you have
had the vision of truth, doubts disappear and questions recede
into silence because, then, nothing shines but the Truth, and
Divinity Itself reveals It’s Reality with showers of Grace. In
this mood and in this spirit, I suggest, you start your search
for Vedic Truth and the Mystery of Existence.


Lastly, if the Vedic lore is as old as humanity itself,
what is its relevance today in the modern world? Ask yourself
other questions: What is the relevance of Galileo or Newton
or the Theory of Relativity, two plus two makes four, Swaraj,
the Vedic word for freedom and self-discipline? Truth is truth,
when the statement was or is made is irrelevant. Vedic truth,
if you find it convincing and acceptable, is relevant not only
for today but also for all time, to every person, everywhere.


( 31111 )


Just as I speak (reveal) this auspicious holy Word of
the Veda for all people (without any discrimination of high
or low), so should you too communicate it to all people of
the world whoever, whatever, wherever they be.

Agni, friend and associate lord of comprehen-
Sive vision, you support the man who goes with the man

a positive and victorious order.


Mandala 1/Sukta 32
Indra Devata, Angirasa Hiranyastupa Rshi






1. Indrasya nu viryani pra vocam yani cakara


I recite and celebrate the first and highest
exploits of Indra, lord of the thunderbolt, refulgent ruler,
which he, like the sun, performs with the shooting rays
of His light. He breaks down the cloud like an enemy,
releases the waters and opens the paths of mountain
streams. (The ruler too, similarly, breaks down the
enemies holding up the powers of the nation for
movement, releases the energies and resources of the
nation, and carves out the paths of progress.)






Indra, lord of shooting rays of light, breaks the
cloud resting on the mountain. Tvashta, creative power
of the Divine, making fine forms and subtle energies,
creates the catalytic power for Him and His shooting
rays against the cloud. And, like cows eager for the
calves, rushing to the stalls, the waters instantly rush
down to the sea.






MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 32 127


Indra, generous lord of showers of light and rain,
receives and drinks up the vital essences present in
heaven, earth and sky, three regions of the created world.
The sun, glorious possessor of heat and water, takes up
the thunderbolt of electric energy and strikes and breaks
up the first born of the dense clouds of vapours.

(So does the ruler hold and rule and enjoy the
rule over his dominion. He takes up his forces and
deploys them to destroy the worst of the nation’s
enemies. And just as the sun is mighty and generous for
the earth, so should the ruler be for his subjects and



4. Yadindrahan prathamajam ahinamanm ayinam


Indra, since you break up the first born of the
clouds of dark vapours and also disperse the powerful
forces of these wonder demons, creating and revealing
thereby the sun and the dawn and the heavens, you will
not, for sure, encounter any enemy.

(So should the ruler too eliminate the enemies
of the land and ensure peace and security for his people.)









Indra, sun and vayu energy, breaks up Vrtra, the
dark thick cloud, denser than demonic, with the fatal
blow of the thunderbolt of lightning. Its shoulders
chopped off by the shooting sharpness of the sword-
like waves of sun-rays, the cloud lies flat on the floor
of the earth (its body turned to rain water).






Like a naive warrior gone mad, Vrtra, the cloud
dared and challenged the sun, great and valiant Indra,
vanquisher of many, reducing them to juice. But he could
not take the force of the blows of Indra, failed and lay
crushed. The streams flow over hills breaking down
mounds of earth.






Indra. Impotent fool he was, desiring equal rivalry with
the mighty hero. Indra struck the lightning thunderbolt
on his shoulder. Beaten and broken all over, Vrtra lies
flat on the earth.


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 32 129




8. Nadam na bhinnamamuya Sayanam mano ruhana


Like a flood let loose, the showers of rain, so
soothing and beautiful to the mind, defy Vrtra, the cloud,
which is now lying shattered on the ground — waters
which, earlier, the cloud had held up with its own might.
Their master now lies trampled under feet on the ground.
(This is the fate of a presumptuous man who proudly
and foolishly challenges the Almighty.)






The earth is the mother of the cloud, below. The
other is the sky up on high. Indra, the sun, strikes Vrtra,
the cloud, with its thunderbolt in the sky and the cloud
comes down with the showers. The earth lies with the
cloud like a cow sleeping with its calf.

(The presumptuous ruler who, thrown up by his
forces, challenges the world ruler meets a fate like the
cloud’s with his forces.)






10. Atisthantinam anivesananam kasthanam madhye


In the non-stop ever flowing streams of the
tracks of the sky is diffused the mysterious body of Vrtra,
the cloud, in the deepest dark. The same rival of Indra
which covered the sun now lies flat on earth and the
water-streams flow (open and beautiful).


(Indra, the ruler, should strike the hidden forces
which cover the light of the order, condense them and
make them flow out openly for the good of the nation.)




11. Dasapatnirahigopa atisthanniruddha apah
panineva gavah. Apam bilamapihitam yadasid-


Like women supported by their husbands, the
waters stay supported by the cloud, hidden in its
darkness like cows in the stall guarded by the cowherd
or the trader. The water-hold that was hidden and closed
was opened and released through the door by the slayer
of Vrtra, Indra, the sun.



12. Asvyo varo abhavastadindra srke yattva pratya-


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 32 131


Tempestuous of speed and power of defence and
offence and as the choice lord and hero do you arise,
Indra, then when the one unique rival, Vrtra, throws its
darkness over your rays of light and catalysis. Arising
then you conquer the earth, you win and collect the vital
soma of life, and you release the seven streams of nectar
to enrich the seven seas of existence as they flow.




13. Nasmai vidyunna tanyatuh sisedha na yam


Neither lightning nor thunder, nor storm and
shower, nor the roar and rumble which Vrtra produces
does resist and stop Indra. When Indra and Vrtra both
battke—Vrtra with inadequate forces—then Indra,
powerful and glorious, comes out victorious.




14. Aheryataram kamapasya indra hrdi yatte


Indra, who ever sees anyone else other than you
as the killer of Vrtra, since in every heart it is your fear,
the victor’s fear, that prevails? And like a victorious
hawk not-afraid you shine and rule over regions of the
world and feed nine and ninety streams of water that


flow and sustain life.




15.  Indro yato’vasitasya raja Samasya ca 5117110


Indra, lord of thunder force of arms, is the ruler
and illuminator of the moving world, settled and
peaceful humanity and the animals. The same ruler holds
and sustains the order of humanity and the world
together and keeps it going.


Mandala 1/Sukta 33
Indra Devata, Angirasa Hiranyastupa Rshi






Come ye, come all, seekers of health and
brilliance of mind and sense, let us approach Indra, lord
supreme of light and knowledge, who feeds, increases
and refines our intelligence along the right lines.
Undying, unborn and eternal, great is He. He increases
the beauty and grandeur of the wealth and grace of this
earth in many ways and then He bestows on us supreme
knowledge and the possession of it.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 33 133


2. Upedaham dhanadamapratitam justam na Syeno


Just as a falcon flies to its favourite haunt and
home, so bowing and praying with exemplary songs
and offerings I yearn to reach Indra, lord of honour and
splendour, giver of wealth, but invisible and
incomprehensible, who alone is adorable for the
worshippers in the world of time.






Indra, lord of hosts and battle, take up the bow
and quiver, shine as you will and win. The victor carries
the prize. Generous and profusely rewarding to the noble
and the splendid, be not ungenerous to us, lofty and
great overlord as you are over us.




4. Vadhirhi dasyum dhaninam dhanenan ekascara-


Indra, lord of power and justice, marching ahead
by yourself, strike down the wicked affluent hoarder
alongwith his supporters with a single blow of the
thunderbolt. Eliminator of smugglers and infiltrators,
fix the selfish fun-lovers on the point of your arrow and








Indra, lord of light and justice, firm and
steadfast, mighty strong, commander of horse power
and armoured force, just as the sun, blazing lord of light
and sustainer of earth, heaven and the middle skies,
breaks up and scatters the cloud, so do you blow off
and scatter the top-notch selfish, uncreative and lawless
elements who rival and stall the yajnic creative,
constructive and productive powers of your dominion.




6. Ayuyutsannanavadyasya senamayatayanta


Settled heroes of the nation, brave fighters,
trained in the latest arms and tactics, experts of offence
and defence, strengthening and elevating the striking
power of the admirable commander of the ruler and
supreme commander, try to fight and fight on so that
the enemies, defeated and demoralised, flee away from
Indra down hill by the swiftest course, like emasculated


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 33 135






Indra, ruler and commander, fight out these
ogres and those, weeping and wailing, away from the
middle regions of the dominion. Throw off the wicked
from the higher regions, and from higher positions.
Raise those who are creators of soma, peace and joy.
Protect those who appreciate and raise the honour of
the world and humanity.




8. Cakranasah parinaham prthivya hiranyena


The fighting forces of the sun, beautified by
golden jewels of light by the sun, messengers of peace
and joy of the earth, do not break the protective cover
of the earth, nor do they violate the purpose of the sun,
and by virtue of the same sun they serve and glorify
Indra, lord ruler of the earth and her children.


(Similarly, the dynamic forces of the earth’s
dominion, invested with the golden jewels of royal
robes, dedicated to service and well-being, do not violate
the bounds of the earth’s protective laws and, as
messengers and agents of the universal lord of light,
they uphold the ruler and the rule of law.)






2. Pari yadindra rodasi ubhe abubhojirmahina


Just as Indra, the sun, with its own power and
glory, holds both earth and heaven in orbit all round in
a State of equilibrium by the force of its gravitation and
throws off the unwanted forces by its own laudable
forces of heat and light, so you, Indra, lord ruler of the
earth, with your power and glory, hold and sustain the
earth and the people and, with the assistance of
responsible and respectable people of knowledge and
divine wisdom, control and correct the unruly elements,
and throw off the selfish and the wicked.




10. Na ye divah prthivya antamapurna mayabhir-


There are those who do not understand the end
and purpose of the earth and heaven, nor can they, with
all their magic and power, conquer or insult the mother
giver earth. Indra, virile and generous lord ruler of earth
and heaven, uses his ready weapon of the thunderbolt
of light and force, kindles the sense and mind of the
people and delivers the earth from the darkness of
ignorance and evil.


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 33 137




11. Anu svadhamaksarannapo asya’vardhata


The waters of this cloud flow according to their
nature, in response to this Indra’s power after the yajnic
offers of holy havi, and they collect in the navigable
lakes, rivers and seas. Indra, lord of lightning power,
strike that cloud of darkness pregnant with waters with
your own essential and most lustrous fatal weapon fast
as mind, break the darkness, and release the light and
waters to flow to the earth.



12. Nyavidhyadilibisasya drdha vi srnginamabhin-


Just as Indra, the sun, lord of light and power,
breaks and scatters the dense cloud into rain water lying
in the depressions of the earth such as lakes and oceans,
and scatters and condenses the mountainous cloud in
the sky which has sucked up the waters from the earth,
similarly, O lord ruler of the earth’s wealth and glory,
strike the underground enemy forces with thunder and
and your lustre and morale sustains.






13. Abhi sidhmo ajigadasya Satrunvi tigmena vrsa-


Just as the never-failing triumphant light of this
sun goes straight and takes on the cloud like an enemy
and, with penetrating but generous force, breaks up the
cloud like enemy fort, just as Indra, solar energy, with
its lightning force, scatters the clouds proclaiming its
distinguished power to the world, so should the ruler
take on and destroy the enemies of the dominion and
proclaim the generous power of his sovereignty.




14. Avah kutsamindra yasmincakanpravo yudhyan-


Indra, as the sun desirous of protecting the earth
takes to the thunderbolt in the battle and engages the
roaring fighting cloud full of showers of rain filling all
the directions, and as the dust raised by the hoofs of the
cows and horses rises to the sky, so may the ruler, son
and protector of the earth, stand firm for the protection
and promotion of humanity.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 34 139


15. Avah samam vrsabham tugrydsu ksetrajese


Indra, Maghavan, lord of power and glory, just
as in matters of the prosperity of the various fields of
the earth the sun directs its catalytic rays of energy to
engage the cloud in battles of precipitation to rain down
the soothing life sustaining showers, so may you, like
the sun and showers, help the people settled here in
peace so that they may for long carry on their earthly
chores. Like the sun, bring the hostile elements of the
dominion to book and keep them down to suffer as they

Asvins, scholars of knowledge and practice,
come our way thrice to guide us. Follow thrice in the

the soul goes from one body to another, as winds blow
from one place to another, so by the threefold, three

Indra is in his heaven of light and justice. The
high-priests sitting on seats of grass in his house of
people assist, complete and promote him, Indra who is
the ruler, guide and protector, in the same manner in
which the lovely streams and mighty rivers join and fill
the sea. In his battles against Vritra, clouds of darkness,
hoarders of national wealth and natural resources, his
fighting forces of defence, powerful, undisturbed and
unopposed, straight and sincere in action stand by him
and follow him steadfast in the battle.






Like streams rushing down to the sea, the
defence forces of this warrior hero, Indra, rush to him
to join in his celebration by soma, Indra, wielder of the
thunderbolt, daring the enemy, who showers the enemy
with a rain of arrows and breaks down the threefold
defence lines of the enemy three ways, up, down and






6. Parim ghrna carati titvise Savo’po vrtvi rajaso


Vritra, the cloud that holds and confines the
vapours of water sleeps in body in the sky. Indra, the
sun, strikes the thunderbolt of lightning on the jaws of
Vritra, a real formidable adversary for the release of the
showers of rain. And then the splendour of Indra spreads
around, glory of power blazes.






Indra, lord of power and ruler of the world, just
as streams of water reach the sea augmenting it, so do
all the wealths of the world and all the songs of divine
celebration converge to you, centre as well as
circumference of existence, and glorify your sublimity.
Tvashta, maker of the forms of existence, designs and
creates the thunderbolt of lightning to augment your
force of arms to use in battle, and he provides that
splendour of valour for you which breaks open the might
of Vritra, hoarded wealth of nature, for the joy of

and powerful songs of praise and prayer rising to the

for humanity move into action and bring showers of
joy from heaven for humanity on earth, then all these
forces and humanity rejoice with thanks and praise to



10. Dyauscidasyamavan aheh svanad ayoyavid




Indra, lord of power and ruler of the world, when
under the inspiration of soma your thunderbolt with
terrible force breaks open the peak of Vritra, the cloud
overcasting the earth and skies, then with thunder and
lightning, the powerful heavens shaking in the operation
catalyse and turn the vapours into rain showers.




11. Yadinnvindra prthivi dasabhujirahani visva


Indra, lord of power, wealth and glory, if the
earth, which is enjoyable with the ten senses, and all

justice and your power of protection and progress, then
your fame and splendour on earth would touch the
heights of heaven.




12. Tvamasya pare rajaso vyomanah svabhityoja


Lord of omnipotent force, master of your own
essential splendour, you are beyond this world of earth
and sky. You create the earth, a symbolic measure of

pervade the earth, the waters, the regions of bliss and
the heavens of light and you are transcendent even




13. Tvam bhuvah pratimanam prthivya rsvavirasya


You are the ultimate measure of the earth and
the skies. You are the highest lord and master of the

having measured the spaces and transcended, you are
the ultimate truth of eternal reality. No one is like you,
none in image, symbol or measure, none, nothing.




14. Na yasya dyavaprthivi anu vyaco na sindhavo


The heaven and earth approach not His infinite
expanse. Nor do the oceans of waters and spaces find
the end of His universe of glory. Nor can any one rival
the power and passion of the generosity of this warrior

matters of the joy of living. Nor has He Himself, sole
Lord as He is, created any one else, or any other world,
like Himself or like the world He has created.






15. Arcannatra marutah sasminnajau visve devaso


Indra, lord of universal power, when you strike
on the jaws of Vritra with the fatal thunderbolt of
dazzling force in all the battles against darkness and
drought, then the Maruts, high-priests of nature and
humanity, sing hymns of praise for you, and all the
divinities of nature and humanity rejoice with you.

Indra Devata, Angirasa Savya Rshi






In this great yajnic house of Vivasvan, lord of

Mandala 1/Sukta 54
Indra Devata, Angirasa Savya Rshi






Indra, lord of the universe and the wealth and
grandeur of life, let us not be boggled in sin and conflicts
of the world. You make the rivers roar, streams to flow
and the springs to sing in praise. Shake us not with fear.
Why shouldn’t the earth and her children, then, attain
to you?

knowledge and wisdom. Sing songs of praise glorifying
the Lord who, with His mighty strength and power of

rides and rushes forward in a chariot drawn by the winds

MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 54 235


From the great regions of light, feeling
passionate and indignant, you strike the top of the cloud
and break it with the shattering thunderbolt of sun-
beams. Similarly, righteously and conscientiously
feeling passionate and indignant, with your formidable
actions, subduing the forces of the wicked and guileful
powers, you raise an army to fight for light and justice.






Just as the sun strikes the thunderbolt of
sunbeams on top of the cloud which holds the life-giving
waters but deprives the earth of rain, so you, striking
the thunderbolt on the head of the living rich but
hoarding wicked powers of society, with your ancient
and advancing powers of knowledge, make them cry
even to-day. Since you were earlier, and now you are,
the hero of action, who can be superior enough to act

Indra, lord and hero of a hundred noble actions,




you protect the good among humanity, the best of them,

of advance and progress and break down the ninety nine
forts of the enemies of humanity.




7. Sa gha raja satpatih susuvajjano ratahavyah prati


He surely is the king, the man, who protects the
good and the true, who knows, enlightens and advances,
who liberally offers in yajna and himself commands
reverence, who advances every unit of the human order
and himself advances in response, who chants the hymns
in honour of Divinity, who is rich and liberal in
prosperity and bright in law and justice, and a liberal
giver over all else. For such a man as this, the higher
powers from above shower rains of grace in generosity.






Indra, unique is your order of governance. Your
intelligence and imagination is unique. May all the
citizens, lovers of soma as they are, prosper by their


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 54 237

Mandala 1/Sukta 55
Indra Devata, Angirasa Savya Rshi






The splendour of this Indra, lord of rule and
light, extends to the lights of heaven. The earth too
cannot rival his greatness with all its expanse. Lord of
strength and power, he is fearsome for the enemies,
warm for the good, and hot and blazing for others. He
radiates light for the dark and strikes the thunderbolt
into the hoarded waters of Vritra and walks around as
the leader among people as leader of the flock.

2. So arnavo na nadyah samudriyah prati grbhnati


Just as the ocean with its bottomless depths
receives and holds the streams of water flowing over
the expansive lands and heading towards the sea, and
just as the sun, with its expanse of heavens, receives
and holds the streams of vapours flowing across the
spaces of the skies and then, like the most generous
lord of life, showers the rains for the earth to have a
drink of the soma of joy, so does the ruler lord of light
and power receive and hold the streams of incoming
wealth heading to the vast expanse of the treasury, and
then like a generous lord of fertility showers the rain of
wealth upon the people for them to have a drink of the
joy of life. This ocean, this sun, this ruler, mighty warrior
and protector rises in strength with his glory since time




devatati cekite visvasma ugrah karmane puro-

Just like that cloud of rain, you rule and govern

Generous he is, joyous and free, full of blessings for

And generous of knowledge, power and protection,
glorious all round, he commands the voice of praise
and appreciation everywhere.






Great warrior as he is, fighting with the
brilliance of his knowledge, wealth and power against
ignorance, injustice and poverty, he wins great battles
for the people. He strikes the thunderbolt against evil,
wickedness and hoarding for the glory of the order, and
then the people vest full faith in him, lord of splendour

the soul, developing projects of growth and progress,
growing stronger and stronger by the earth, destroying

creating the lights of art, science, beauty and culture,
rendering the homes and highways free from danger
and highway men, should set the wheels of humanity in
motion and keep the waters flowing abundantly for the
yajamana and the yajnic nation.






Indra, lord creator of soma and lover of the drink
of joy, may your heart and mind concentrate on giving.
Lord of fame commanding admiration and reverence,
direct your dynamic and magnetic forces this way for
progress and stability. May your charioteers, leaders and
guides of the nation, be experts on the steering wheel

brilliant intentions. May no enemies be able to injure
and suppress or terrorize you.

the same I hold and cherish.


Mandala 1/Sukta 56
Indra Devata, Angirasa Savya Rshi






This Indra, lord protector of the land, advances
to meet, guide and protect his people just as the smartest
young man advances and wins the hand of his lady love.
And, holding them as sacred libations in the ladle for
offering into the yajna fire, he ascends the excellent,

augment his power and majesty deep as the ocean and






He, Indra, blessed and blissful, great, inviolable,

If a generous and brilliant beauty were to come

security and progress of society, then, just as the sun
having joined the wonderful dawn, dispels the world
enveloping darkness with his blazing splendour so
would Indra dispel the darkness and suffering of
humanity with his power and splendour.






Mighty is Indra, blazing in splendour and
rejoicing in the light of heaven. In the vast spaces of
the universe, he wields and sustains indestructible life
supports such as earths and skies. He catalyses the
vapours of water held in the depths of space, breaks the
clouds, and in the mood of power, glory and joy makes
them shower the rains on the earth, thereby forming the
ocean.

Agni Devata, Nodha Gautama Rshi




1. Nu cit sahoja amrto ni tundate hota yad dito


Agni, surely born of strength and omnipotence,
and immortal, never hurts. Giver and receiver of
oblations, it is the carrier of yajna and inspirations of
the Divine. Coexistent with other powers of nature, it
traverses the paths of spaces from earth to heavens.
Divine among divinities, when it is fed on holy offerings,
it shines itself and shines others with light.







Unaging and immortal, instantly consuming its
food, it protects the environment and abides in the winds


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 58 249

Immortal agent of nature’s karma, living and
acting with pranic energies and the abodes and supports

you instantly shower the supplicants with favours, may
we, we pray, share your love and protection.








Voracious power of the jaws of flame, enveloped
in the rays of its own light, inspired by the energy of
Vayu, it moves around bold and fearless like a bull in
the herd of cows in the forest far and near. It moves
across the moving and undecaying world of earth and
sky up and down with its force, and the world feels
afraid of it whether it stays or flies like a bird.

Agni, light and life of the universe, other agnis,

only. All the immortals of the world, devas, jivas and

and leading light of the earthly worlds, you are the navel,
centre-hold of the earths and the people, and, like the
pillar of a house or the hub of the wheel of existence,
you hold the people in the law of Dharma and keep
them in their orbit.

the earth, and it is the ruler of the earths, the skies and
the heavens all. Vaishvanara, leading light of the

honour of Vaishvanara, life universal, self-existent, ever
truly powerful and the best friend of humanity.







Vaishvanara, lord omniscient and omnipresent

wicked, He shakes the quarters of space and terrifies
the demons of evil.






Vaishvanara, lord pervasive and leader of the
world of existence, is the lord of world humanity by
virtue of His might and grandeur. Among the sources
of life sustenance such as earth and showers of rain, He
is the light and glory of the man of yajna. Lord of the

reality of existence and the word of truth, in the world
of hundredfold splendour, Agni is praised and
worshipped in a hundred manners in choric songs by
the celebrants.

operative in wind and electricity, bears Agni, carrier of
oblations, mark of fame and honour, honour flag of the
yajna of the world, worthy of preservation and
advancement, instant mover and messenger, always
valuable, twice born of Heaven and Vayu for earth and
the skies. Vayu bears it like a real celebrity and beauty
and generous giver in life and conducts it to Bhrgu,
scientist and technologist, for heat treatment from
cooking to tempering of sophisticated materials. (The
Bhrgu collects and develops the fire.)



2. Asya sasurubhayasah sacante havismanta usijo


Ordinary people and men of means both, who




are ambitious for noble yajnic acts, abide by the law
and order of this ruler of truth and justice. Giver as well
as receiver of the gifts of yajna, man of discriminate
wisdom, protector of the people, intelligent and highly
knowledgeable, he takes his place among the people
like the sun before the rise of day.






To the man of noble honey tongue, whom men
of yajnic service, men of means and knowledge, seniors
with vision and experience and the people in general
raise higher and greater in the battle of life, to such a
man rising high and higher, may new and newer

top and commands the nation.






Agni, lord of light and leader, Agni, lord creator
and protector of the wealth of nations, instant in action,
commanding speed and prosperity, we, men of the
Divine Word, with all our mind and intelligence, with
all the saints and the wise, cleansing, sanctifying and
anointing you as leader, praise and celebrate you, and
we pray that the lord of wealth and intelligence may
come post-haste and bless us in the early morning.


Mandala 1/Sukta 61
Indra Devata, Gautama Nodha Rshi




1. Asma idu pra tavase turaya prayo na harmi


In honour of this lord Indra, mighty power, great
leader, holy celebrity and commander of the brave,
informidable to the enemies, I offer an excellent song
of praise in adoration and holiest offerings of the most
spontaneous and liberal homage.








You offer to this Indra, lord of life and power,
libations of homage and reverence like gifts of dainty
food. So do I bear and offer to him songs of praise well-
structured and formulaic modes of defence and
protection against the enemies of humanity. Come ye
all, cleanse your mind honestly by heart, mind and soul
for Indra, ancient and eternal lord of life and light, and






For the sake of the advancement of Agni, the
ruler, and of the people of knowledge and wisdom, I
speak noble and powerfully persuasive words in support
of this exemplary, generous, revered and magnanimous
hero, a great man of wisdom and piety of conduct.




4. Asma idu stomam sam hinomi ratham na tasteva


MANDAL - 1/SUKTA - 61 259


For this Indra, ruling lord of knowledge and
power, master promoter of divine speech and veteran
of wisdom, I create and float a song of praise of universal
and persuasive purport and use words of discriminating
wisdom to strengthen his power and control over the
land and people just as an engineer creates a strong
structure for the chassis of the master’s chariot.






As a driver yokes the horse to the master’s
chariot to drive him on, so, in honour of Indra and in
order to celebrate and exalt him, the brave hero as he is,
treasure home of charity and destroyer of enemy
strongholds, whose fame rings far and wide, I compose
a song in my own words and offer it as a libation to him
with my own ladle in homage.




6. Asma idu tvasta taksad vajram svapastamam


Let Tvashta, the Maker, design and form for this
Indra, ruling Lord of power and defence, the thunderbolt
of lightning force blazing for the battle so that he (Indra),
striking with this fatal weapon, taking many enemies
on, may reach the mortal centrespot of Vritra, the cloud




of darkness and ignorance (and release the showers of
rain and prosperity and the light of knowledge).






In the yajnic programmes of this Indra, lord of
rule and power who measures everything to size, Vishnu,
the great sun pervading everything with its light, drinks
up the delicious holy foods prepared and sent up
sanctified from the yajna, and then, challenging the
mountainous cloud hoarding up the wealth of the same
yajnic foods in the form of vapours, breaks up the cloud
and throws it down (releasing the showers of rain).




8. Asma idu gnascid devapatnirindrayarkamahi-


For this Indra, blazing as the sun with light and
grandeur, holy voices served and preserved by noble
sages and scholars composed hymns of praise and
offered homage to Indra on the break up of the cloud.
Indra holds both the vast heaven and earth, but these
two do not comprehend his grandeur and greatness
(which exceeds heaven and earth both).


MANDAL - 1/SUKTA - 61 261


MAUS


0. Asyedeva pra ririce mahitvam divasprthivyah


Surely the greatness and grandeur of this Indra
exceeds the heaven, skies and earth. The self-refulgent
hero, universal warrior, brilliant and brave, infinitely
strong and bold, resounds in the universe for battle
against evil and negation.




10. Asyedeva Savasa Susantam vi vrscad vajrena


O lord of power and law, with the strength and
rectitude of this Indra, the universal force of Divinity
uproots the exploitative forces, just as the sun breaks
down the cloud which holds up the rain and scorches
the earth. And just as held up cows are released from
the stalls, so the ruler releases the streams of life on the
earth, enlightened hero as he is, who releases food and
justice for the powers of generosity.


11. Asyedu tvesasa ranta sindhavah pari yadvajrena






By the might and splendour of this Indra, the
rivers flow and seas roll at will since he gives the blow
(to Vritra and releases the waters below). Ruler,
controller, and giver of power and honour, instantly
victorious, giving liberally to the generous, he creates
firm standing ground for the speedy success of




12. Asma idu pra bhara tutujano vrtraya vajrami-


Indra, ruling lord of manifold power, fast and
impetuous, wields the thunderbolt of sunrays for this
Vritra, cloud of vapours and darkness, and releasing
the waters for the streams to flow on earth, breaks the
layers of vapours with the thunderbolt as lightning
breaks things into pieces bit by bit.




13. Asyedu pra bruhi purvyani turasya karmani navya

Sing and celebrate the old and new exploits of
this fast and powerful Indra in songs of praise, Indra
who, passionate and tempestuous, updating and
wielding the weapons for battle, strikes and destroys
the enemies.






14. Asyedu bhiya girayasca drlaha dyava ca bhuma


By the power and holy fear of this omnipotent
Indra, the mountains stay firm and fixed, and the heaven
and earth and the people shake with awe. The leader,
abiding in the protective shade of this intelligent and
handsome power and chanting words of praise
immediately rises and grows capable of great action.




15. Asma idu tyadanu dayyesameko yad vavne


Indra, sole one lord of himself is the absolute
ruler of many. Whatever he wills of these and
commands, the same is rendered in reverence and
obedience. And Indra himself advances and protects the
hero of power and honour who, fighting for victory in
the battle of horse, spurs on his steed in the direction of
the sun.



16. Eva te hariyojana suvrktindra brahmani gota-




Indra, O Lord of sunbeams, these are the songs
divine, purest and serene, offered by the highest souls
of faith and vision. Bless these souls with universal
brilliance of vision and intelligence, lord omniscient.
Lord Omnificent, reveal your presence in our mind
instantly with the light of the dawn.


Mandala 1/Sukta 62
Indra Devata, Nodha Gautama Rshi






With selected words of purity and pious deeds
we offer songs of adoration to Indra, lord omnipotent,
poet of Divine omniscience, universal object of worship,
celebrated in the Rgveda, sole guide of humanity and
celebrated in story all over the world, and we pray for
strength and knowledge as for the very breath of life.






All ye men and women of the world, bear and
offer to Indra, great lord of strength and power,
celebrative songs of adoration and holy offerings in


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 62 265


Samans and hymns of knowledge and enlightenment,
by virtue of which our ancient forefathers, who knew
the life stages of Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha
and who were scholars of divine knowledge and
worshippers of the Lord, received the gift of holy speech
and universal knowledge.






Just as a mother gives milk to the child, as
Brihaspati, the sun, breaks the cloud with its rays and
the light reaches the earth, so you, men and women of
the world, in the yajna of Indra and the yajnic
programmes of the scholars of science and society,
shining and advancing like sun-rays, spread the light of
knowledge and the joy of life.




4. Sa sustubha sa stubha sapta vipraih svarenadrim


Just as the bright sun breaks the powerful clouds
with its fresh, all embracing, all expansive, sustaining
and sustained but resounding rays of light, similarly
Indra, powerful ruler of the world, shining and
resounding, with balanced and all-sustaining order,
seven orders of the wise, his rolling voice, new and all




expansive radiating powers and burning and roaring
weapons, breaks down the thick and powerful clouds
of darkness which hoard the system’s life and progress.




5. Grnano angirobhirdasma vi varusasa suryena


Indra, lord of wondrous deeds, proclaiming his
power and presence by the pranic energies of nature,
the dawn, the sun and the sun-rays, dispels the darkness
and creates the food for life and growth. He expands
the earth and the hills and mountains of the earth and
stabilizes the heights of the skies and the heavens.


So should the ruler proclaim his power and
presence dispelling the darkness of ignorance, injustice
and poverty, create food and prosperity and thereby
expand the character, power and potential of the land
and stabilize the common wealth of humanity.




6. Tadu paryaksatamam asya karma dasmasya


The most charming act and the most admirable
achievement of this lord Indra of wondrous deeds 18
that in the business of life on the earth all the streams
and rivers and all the four directions of space are full
and abundant with delicious waters and flow for all the


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 62 267








Indra, valiant lord of infinite action, concealed
and held and then revealed a duality of creation, two
complementarities, both born of the same mother,
Prakrti, and both coexistent and cooperative, both held
by waves of energy (light and dark), both doing homage
to the lord creator. He, Bhaga, lord of existence and
master of materials, held the two in space as two co-
workers, complementary like the sun holding heaven
and earth and the skies in eternal space.




8. Sanad divam pari bhuma virupe punarbhuva


Since time immemorial, from the same eternal
cause, co-existent and cooperative from heaven to earth,
the two complementarities of distinctive forms, night
and day, both ever young and born again and again,
move on and on by their own path together yet
separately, the night in the forms of darkness and the
day in the forms of light. Both move in and on serving
the heaven and earth.






9. Sanemi sakhyam svapasyamanah sunurdadhara


Lord of the thunderbolt, eternal creator, master
of wondrous actions, beatific in performance by his own
might holds and maintains equality of company and
cooperation between the light and the dark, raw and
ripe, just as he holds the same herbal juice in the mature
as well as the maturing vegetation and the same white
milk in the white, dark and ruddy cows.




10. Sanat sanila avaniravata vrata raksante amrtah


Since time immemorial, born of the same cause,
Prakrti, coexistent and cooperative, thousands of earths
immortal in their own nature, undisturbed even by a
breath of wind, observe the eternal laws of their
existence with their innate powers. And as mothers
nourish their child, wives love and serve their husbands,
and sisters love and cooperate with their brothers, they
do homage to the bold and intrepidable Indra.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 62 269


11. Sanayuvo namasa navyo arkairvasuyavo matayo


Indra, lord adorable of wondrous action, bright
and generous, people of intelligence, faith and
meditation, desirous of wealth and food for the body,
mind and soul, lovers of yajna, rush to you offering gifts
of homage with hymns of praise and prayer as loving
wives in passion approach the loving husbands and feel
immortalised by the beatific touch of your presence.




12. Sandadeva tava rayo gabhastauna ksiyante nopa


Since eternity, O lord of infinite light and
generosity, the wealths in your open hand never
decrease, never will they exhaust. You are the lord
supreme of light and knowledge. You are the lord of
omnipotence. You are the master of the dynamics of
existence. You are calm and constant. You are the lord of
kindness, favour and grace. Enlighten us with the light
of knowledge. Bless us with your favours and grace.


13. Sanayate gotama indra navyamataksad brahma






Indra, lord of omnipotence and infinite action,
lord omnipresent of infinite motion, since eternity you
are ever present just at hand. Nodha, the poet of constant
adoration, Gotama, spirit of fastest thought and
imagination, creates the latest songs of celebration in
honour of you, lord of universal light and humanity,
lord giver of infinite freedom and joy. May the lord of
eternal wealth and joy, may the spirit of eternal vision
and imagination be with us upon the instant with the
light of the dawn.


Mandala 1/Sukta 63
Indra Devata, Gautama Nodha Rshi






Indra, lord omnipresent, great you are indeed
who, manifest in creation, hold the heaven and earth in
your power and law of omnipotence. It is by that eternal
power and awe that all the mighty mountains and the
impetuous rays of light do not deviate from their fixed




2. A yaddhari indra vivrata vera te vajram jarita


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 63 271


Indra, lord almighty of immaculate action,
universally invoked, when you deploy your forces of
movement and advance, observing the rules and
discipline of your universal law, your worshippers and
admirers too hold in their arms the same thunderbolt of
law by which you destroy the many strongholds of the
enemies of life and humanity.






Indra, you are ever true, constant destroyer of
these negativities of life and nature. You are the protector
and promoter of the wise artists and scientists. You are
the leader and friend of humanity. You are ever patient
and forbearing. In the great battles of unity and
fulfilment, you eliminate want and drought for the sake
of the young generation, bright and brave wielders of
the force of the thunderbolt of plenty and righteousness.




4. Tvam ha tyadindra codth sakha vrtram yad vajrin


You only, for sure, Indra, are the universal friend,
wielder of the thunderbolt, and hero of vast operation
who take on the cloud of darkness and want, overthrow
the demon of want and darkness and shower the




blessings of plenty and fulfilment and who, O brave
one, generous at heart, by nature and instinct nip evil
and wickedness in the bud itself.




5. Tvam ha tyadindrarisanyan drlhasya cinmarta-


Indra, lord of the thunderbolt, you surely are he
who is unwilling to injure the strong and firm among
humanity and the strong and stable system of the order.
Fall like a hammer upon the disagreeables of humanity,
fix them, and scatter the unfriendly as the sun scatters
the clouds, and open the paths of advancement for
progress in all directions.




6. Tvam ha tyadindrarnasatau svarmilhe nara aja


In the tumult of the battles of the brave for
victory and the showers of peace and joy, the leaders of
humanity call upon you, Indra, to join the strife and
win. Lord of innate wealth and power, may this help
and protection of yours be available to us in our joint
ventures and our battles for food, knowledge, science
and social progress.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 63 273


8. Tvam ha tyadindra sapta yudhyan puro vajrin


Indra, lord of the thunderbolt, ruler of the world,
fighting seven evils and defending the seven-fold power
of the order, you break down the strongholds of sin and
crime for the sake of the generous and the many
splendoured social order. Uproot the sin and crime like
grass and deliver the wealth to the people for the sake
of joy and fulfilment and take the order to the heights
of the sky. (The sevenfold powers are: the council,
councillors, president, army, commander, services and
the people.)




8. Tvam tyam na indra deva citramisamapo na


Indra, brilliant lord of generosity, ever present and
all protective, brave hero, ruler and holder of the world,
like the flow of nature’s waters, let that various and
wondrous energy, mind and means flow freely for us for
the expression and fulfilment of our spiritual self by which
you again and again direct and guide the conduct of our
soul as well as the psychic flow of our energy.








Indra, lord of the world, by the most eminent
sages of vision and intelligence, like fast motions of
light rays for the sun, songs of homage have been
presented with heart and soul with offerings of faith
and reverence and sung for you.


May the same lord of wealth and intelligence
come to us and bless us with wondrous wealth of food,
light and energy at the break of dawn.


Mandala 1/Sukta 64
Maruts Devata, Gautama Nodha Rshi






Nodha, poet of vision and wisdom, come and
sing a song of celebration in selected words of pure
beauty for the generous, mighty and omniscient lord of
universal yajna and in honour of the Maruts, divine
energies of universal motion. Settled and constant, pure
and fluent as waters, dexterous of hand in structure and
form, with heart and soul I compose, adorn and chant
holy voices revealed in meditation, presenting
themselves as celebrants of the Lord.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 64 275


2. Te jajnire diva rsvasa uksano rudrasya marya


Those Maruts, waves of winds, children of the
light of heaven, reveal the light of knowledge. Friends
of humanity, they are the breath of Rudra, cosmic energy
of prana, generous, inspiring, pure and unpolluted, pure
and purifying, brilliant as sunbeams, replete with vitality,
carrying particles of living energy, they are awful and
sublime in form.





Fresh, powerful and ever young, dynamic
catalytic energies, unaging, free from suffering and
death, they grow and augment. Unseen and irresistible
in motion, strong and steady as mountains, with their
power and force they move everything on earth and in
heaven and all the worlds in existence.



4. Citrairanjibhirvapuse vyanjate vaksahsu rukman

In various colourful shapes they manifest and




define themselves in beautiful forms of nature. They
activate the heat and light of vitality in the body system.
Their dynamic powers shine in the athletic shoulders
of their favourite heroes. Life of heroic people, they
arise and shine with their innate light and power from






Creators and makers of ruling powers on earth,
they are the movers and shakers of things and people.
Destroyers of the destroyers, they generate winds and
lightning with their blazing splendour. They distil the
essence of energy from the celestial sources of nature
and, vibrating every particle of matter and energy, they
feed the earth with the nectar of vitality while they go
round in spaces at their tempestuous speed.




6. Pinvantyapo marutah sudanavah payo ghrta-vad


The generous Maruts, waves of cosmic energy,
feed the vitality of waters. Instantly present at the yajnas
of nature and humanity, as they radiate the ghrta across
the spaces, so they feed and augment milk and juices


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 64 277


from spaces. And for the sake of rain, like a horse in the
reins, they rule the floating cloud and the lightning
thunder and milk the cloud like a perennial spring for
life.




Mighty strong and strengthening, magical
stimulators of intelligence and performance, various and
versatile in heat and light, innately powerful and firmly
rooted as mountains and inherently rich as clouds, the
winds are impetuous in motion as the shooting deer and
mighty as the elephants which destroy the forests. If
you use these brilliant powers of light and winds in your
fieriest forces of creation and defence you would destroy
the destroyers and protect the beauties of life and nature
and enjoy yourselves.



8. Simha iva nanadati pracetasah pisa iva supiso


Like lions, the Maruts roar and proclaim the
nature of nature (since, as waves of energy, they are in
touch with everything 111 existence and hence know what




itis). Powerful as they are possessed of minute particles
of energy they possess the world and put you in touch
with everything if you know them. Keeping everything
in its own shape and order, coexistent with the clouds
in their action of sun and shower, they vitalise the nights
with the showers of their waves like mists.


(If you know the Maruts, you know what they
touch and proclaim.)




9. Rodasi a vadata ganasriyo nrsacah surah sasa-


Maruts, scholars, soldiers, leaders of humanity,
organised in graceful classes, friends of mankind, brave,
breakers of the clouds, with your own power reach over
earth and heaven, address them and proclaim of them.
And may the Maruts, energies of winds, like lightning,
electric energy, in beautiful body form, come and sit in
the strong structure of your cars to take you over earth
and heaven.




10. Visvavedaso rayibhih samokasah sammislasa-




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 64 279


Maruts, voracious eaters, excellent and exuberant, who
know and rule the world live together with all their
wealth together, mix together in equal homes with all
their light and power of the elements, hold immense
strength in their hands, fix the arrow on the bow and
shoot. They are the real men, the Maruts.




11. Hiranyayebhih pavibhih payovrdha ujjighnanta


Maruts, creators and promoters of water, juice
and milk, powers of cosmic yajna, advancing, self-
driven, shakers of the fixed, makers of the firm,
brandishing their burnishing steel, shatter the mountains
and scatter the clouds like leaves on the pathways by
the golden wheels of their chariots.




12. Ghrsum pavakam vaninam vicarsanim rudrasya


We invoke, praise and celebrate in song the band
of Maruts, nature’s powers of grinding and crushing,
purifying as fire with refinement, generous, ever active,
children of Rudra, 1.e., products of cosmic metabolism
in the process of joining, disjoining, consuming and




creating. You too love, study and serve the Maruts, most
active energy of the universe, fiery and powerful,
creative and collective forces which bestow the gifts of
life on us. Do so for beauty, prosperity and grace.






O Maruts, surely that person soon surpasses
other people with power and merit and settles whom
you protect and promote with your favours. He achieves
food, energy and success with the fastest means of
movement and progress, gets the desired wealth for the
asking with the people around, and collects and
advances the wealth and beauty of yajnic life.





O Maruts, heroes of the world, bear for us valour
and virility of sustained value for work, strength and
courage irresistible in battles, and brilliant excellence
among people of power and honour. Bless us with a
son and a grandson, winner of wealth and victory,


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 65 281


worthy of praise and universally admirable, whom we
may nurse, nourish, protect and promote for a hundred
years to advance in life.




15. Nu sthiram maruto viravantamrtisaham rayima-


O Maruts, heroes of humanity fast as winds, bear
who are ever felicitous and victorious, and happiness
of a hundred fold and a thousandfold order. May the
spirit of pious intelligence and wealth of mind and soul
visit and bless us instantly with the light of dawn.


Mandala 1/Sukta 65
Agni Devata, Parashara Shaktya Rshi




1. Pasva na tayum guha catantam namo yujanam


Tracing and following the foot-prints of the
animal, the master finds where the cattle carrier is hiding
in the cave. So do all the yajakas, loving together and
dedicated, patient and constant in their search, follow
you, Agni, by yogaic stages and find you where you are
hiding in the cave of the heart, creating and commanding
food and energy, bearing and bestowing food and energy




of life, and they sit close around you, preparing and
feeding the fire, seeking and finding.






Noble yajakas dedicate themselves to the Law
of Truth in sacred vows. The search for Agni goes on.
They augment the waters, exalt the earth and, with their
noble actions, promote the agni born in the vedi at the
centre of the womb of nature and the Laws of Divinity.
And the earth grows bright and blest as heaven.





Delightful as the glow of health, vast and happy
waters, fast as a flying horse in rapid motion, deep and
rolling as the sea, who can stop it, just at hand as it is?




4. Jamih sindhunam bhrateva svasramibhyanna raja


It is a friend of the seas, dear as a brother of his


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 66 283


sisters. It rules over the wealthy as over its attendants,
and devours the forests. Driven by the winds, it abides
in the waters, clouds and the sunbeams. And it is only
Agni which matures and harvests the grasses and herbs
of the earth.





It breathes in the waters, vitalising them, playing
with them like a swan. Most intelligent and wide-awake,
it awakens the people at dawn with its light and yajnic
action. Born of Divine Law and Truth of Nature, it is an
inspirer and energiser like soma. Playful as a calf, it is
omnipresent, shining far and wide.


Mandala 1/Sukta 66
Agni Devata, Parashara Shaktya Rshi




1. Rayirna citra suro na samdrgayurna prano nityo


Wondrous as wealth and beauty, illuminating
as the sun, breath of energy as life itself, ever present
and essentially constant as a son, restless as a falcon,
abiding with the forests and sunbeams, a very mother
cow, nourishing and life-giving as milk, it is pure and


blazing, shining and revealing all.






It is the treasure of peace and welfare. Soothing
as ahome and food as barley, it is the winner of victories
for humanity. Worthy of reverence as a seer, it is admired
of people. It is worthy of admiration as a war-chariot
and bears life, energy and long age for us.


3. Durokasocih kraturna nityo jayeva yonavaram




Lord of awful light for all places, eternal like
the yajna of creation, beauty of the home like the wife,
for all, wondrous of form and character that shines
among people like the very sunlight, it is magnificent
as a watrior’s chariot, blazing in battles with victory.




4. Seneva srstamam dadhatyasturna didyut tvesa-


Like an army sent up to advance in battle, it


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 67 285


wields power and force. Like an electric missile of fire
itis blazing and voracious, a symbol of light and fire. It
is the guide, controller, and destiny of all that is born,
and the guide, controller and destiny of all that is on
way to life. It is the paramour of maidens and the
protector of wives.






Just as cows return to their stall, just as rays of
the sun withdraw to the sun, just as streams and rivers
flow down to the sea, so may we all, moving as well as
settled people, attain to you, Agni, light of the sun, and
the Lord Almighty.


Mandala 1/Sukta 67
Agni Devata, Parashara Shaktya Rshi






Just as a ruler selects a young, unaging and
enthusiastic worker, best of the desirable lot and
friendliest among people, so does Agni select and bless
a devotee for the divine mission of life’s yajna. May
this Agni, Lord of yajna, Itself the giver and receiver,




carrier of the fragrances across life and the world,
immanent in forests and manifest in sunbeams,
happiness incarnate, creative and blissful as yajna itself
be our sustainer, protector and promoter in life and select
us for the sacred mission of Divinity.






People of faith and dedication, possessed of
sacred intelligence who chant and meditate on mantras,
divining into the secrets of nature and divinity with their
heart and soul, come to know and realise here itself in
actuality the presence and attributes of Agni which is
immanent in the depth of the soul, reveals Itself, holding
the wealths of the world for the devotees, and establishes
the dedicated generous brilliancies in knowledge, power
and wealth of the world and protects and promotes them
in life.


The eternal lord of existence, Agni, light and


life of the universe, holds the earth as He holds the sky
and sustains heaven in space with true mantras of Rtam


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 67 287


(which are identical with His thoughts and laws of
nature). Agni, lord and spirit of the universe, deepest in
the depth of the soul as you are, protect the steps of the
growth of the soul’s vision of divinity, guard them
against the violence and vulgarity of brute force.




4. Yaim ciketa guha bhavantama yah sasada dhara


One who knows Agni existent in the cave of
the heart, takes the shower in the stream of Truth and
life flowing from Divinity. Those who tie the knot with
the presence, serve It and shine the path of realisation
along the steps, to them Agni reveals the secrets of the
wealths of life and light of the Spirit.






Agni, that universal spirit and energy of life
which manifests in form and measure in the shoots that
come forth in the herbs and trees and in the child in the
womb of the mother, that superconsciousness, the
realised souls experience when they have collected their
consciousness as if behind closed doors, when even the
motion of their pranas has been stilled.


(The energy of life which is the heat, vitality




and glow of health in life forms, which is universally
active, the scientists and yogis realise in a state of total


Mandala 1/Sukta 68
Agni Devata, Parashara Shaktya Rshi






The blazing, vibrating, ripening, perfecting
power and energy of the Lord, Agni, that sustains and
beautifies the world pervades and abides by the moving
and non-moving forms of existence and covers as well
as brightens and defines the day and night with His
presence. He is the sole one lord and light of all the
brilliancies of the universe by virtue of His own might.






Brilliant lord of existence, most generative
support of life-force arising from dry sources of energy,
all the brilliancies of the universe join your sacred act
of creation. All of them worship your divinity in truth
and faith. All of them with all their manners, customs,
rituals, in short with every motion of their thought and

Agni, first impulse of creative intelligence,
wielder of the laws of Truth and laws of evolution, life

bidding and perform their action. Lord all percipient
and omniscient, whosoever be intelligent and give away
charity in homage to you or learn from your eternal Word
and universal acts, bless him/her with the wealth of the




4. Hota nisatto manorapatye sa cinnvasam pati


Lord of light, high-priest of the cosmic yajna of
creation and generation, receiver of oblations and
creator and begetter of blessings, immanently seated in
humanity, Agni is the lord ruler and controller of these
wealths of life, and its yajnic creations. Ye men and
women of intelligence and generative science mutually
desirous of creative energy and fertility together in your
body system, know the science of generative yajna with


your knowledge, education and expertise.




5. Piturna putrah kratum jusanta srosan ye asya


If men of genius and action were to dedicate
themselves to yajna and listen to the divine voice and
obey the discipline and command of this divine Agni as
children listen to the father and do his behest, then the
omnificent Lord of wealth and omnipotence would bless
them with showers of wealth and open the beautiful
doors of heaven and happiness to them.


Mandala 1/Sukta 69
Agni Devata, Parashara Shaktya Rshi






Bright and blazing, pure and purifying as the

2. Garbho yo apam garbho vananam Garbhasca


Agni abides at the heart of the waters and the
pranic energies of the universe. It is at the heart of
forests, sunbeams and all the lovely and beloved
beauties of the world. It is at the heart of all that is still
and all that moves. It abides in the cloud and in the
mountain and it is the centre of the homes of people.
Universal, immortal, free and absolute, it is the very
life and ruler of everything in nature as it is the life and
ruler of all the people for their sake only.






That Agni is the lord of night and day. It is the
giver of wealth and power in ample measure for anyone
who adores it with hymns of divinity. It is aware of all,
knows the manifestations and operations of all the
divinities of nature, and it knows all that are mortal.
Lord of knowledge, wealth and power, protect and
promote all these children of nature and the earth.






4. Vardhanyam purvih ksapo virupah sthatusca


The nights and days of various hues and forms

in-vest the cows and forests and the earth and sunbeams

the world.


Mandala 1/Sukta 71
Agni Devata, Parashara Shaktya Rshi






Like married women in a state of love and desire
meeting the loving husband for the joy of living, like
cows of the same stall going up and out to welcome
and feel the sallow, ruddy, wonderful and brilliant dawn,
harbinger of light, for a fresh lease of life, let all the
people together in love and faith always worship the
wondrous, loving protector, Agni, eternal father, for a
fresh lease of life and the joy of living.




2. Vilu cid drlha pitaro na ukthairadrim rujanna-


Our forefathers sustain our strength and
constancy. The Angirasas, sustainers of life, the winds,

us with the voice of thunder. They create the path to the
vast heaven and the space and show us the way to rise




to the sun. They know the light of the dawn, the
brilliance of the day and the bliss of heaven. They give
us the light, the day and the bliss and vest us with an
identity of splendour, a banner of recognition and a ruler
and the law.






Holding on to Truth and Dharma, wielding the
knowledge and power of Agni, lord of light, then

and help without thirst or selfishness, doing good acts
with generosity of giving food and social service and
promoting nobilities, specially children, the people and
specially Brahmacharinis move on in life with grace.




4. Mathid yadim vibhrto matarisva grhegrhe Syeto


If the wind, bearing the wealth of agni, and
others were to churn out and produce fire and electricity
which then emerges bright and victorious in every home,
then the scholars of science would refine and develop
it for the purpose of communication and transport and


MANDAL - 1/SUKTA - 71 297


use it as ambassador for the grand ruling power and
order of the society between one people and another in






It is the sun, self-refulgent giver of comfort and
bliss, reaching all with its rays, knowing all and revealing
all, who creates the nectar of life for the great fatherly lord
of heaven, Agni, who radiates light like a mighty hero of
the bow shooting arrows for the purpose of humanity,
and who vests the light and splendour of the morning in
its daughter, the dawn, dispelling the darkness. Who can
get away from it or steal the light? None.






Agni, lord of light and life, who ever lights the
fire in the home in the vedi, whoever in fervent love
and faith offers food and reverence in yajna every day,
you, giver of twofold advancement in knowledge and
valour, grant him full age of honour and glory. Who
ever you inspire and send up to battle of the chariot,


you bless with the all-round wealth of life.






All foods, all that move and ripen go to Agni

web of our life is incomprehensible to those on the move.
May the Lord of Omniscience direct our will and
intelligence and establish us among the wise and the
brilliant sages of vision.





When pure light and lustre, living and sanctified,
come to the ruling soul for the fulfilment of desire and
perfection, then Agni creates the strong, praiseworthy,

MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 72 299

immortal values of life on earths as milk in the cows:
all this is the gift of Agni.

10. Mano agne sakhya pitryani pra marsistha abhi


Agni, lord giver and protector of life, let not
our ancestral values of love and friendship be destroyed,
all-knowing and visionary creator as you are. Old age
destroys the health and beauty of life as the cloud covers
and hides the sun and sky. Lord protector and preserver,
come before the onslaught of that, stop that and help us


Mandala 1/Sukta 72
Agni Devata, Parashara Shaktya Rshi






Agni, the man of faith and devotee of Agni, lord
of life, light and wealth of existence, holding in hand

omniscience, all-time beneficial to humanity, observing
the rules of Dharma, and doing all the essential acts of
immortal value becomes the highest master of the
wealths of life and existence.




2. Asme vatsam pari santam na vindannicchanto

all the immortal souls, men of divine intelligence
dedicated to divine love, relentlessly following the paths
of Divinity, holding on to piety of faith in reason and
passion both, reach and abide in the beatific state of
supreme bliss in Agni’s direct presence.






Agni, lord of light and cosmic yajna of
evolution, those people of pure and dedicated soul who
serve you, lord of purity, for three years with oblations
of ghrta in yajna would justify their name with fame

divine knowledge, attains to the beatific vision of Agni
abiding in the highest state of man’s spiritual experience.




oF Sanjanana upa sidannibhijnu patnivanto nama-


Knowing well the science of yajna, let men of
yajna with their wives sit on their knees doing homage
to the adorable Agni and to others, parents, teachers
and seniors. Men of purity, they would be purifying their
own bodies, and they would abide as friends protecting
each other in yajnic action and protected by yajna every
moment of their life.








Agni, lord of life and positive living, those
devotees established in you and dedicated to yajna, who
know and achieve the thrice-seven deep and secret
stages of yajna and abide therein, protect and preserve
thereby the immortal wealth of life. Lovers of yajna and
the yajnics, protect and promote all movable and
immovable wealth of life, humans and animals all.


(According to Swami Dayanand the thrice-seven
are: reading, reflection and meditation across the four
Vedas, knowledge, practice and industry through
Dharma, universal values of life, Artha, economic and
social achievement, Kama, love and emotional
fulfilment, and Moksha, ultimate freedom. Another way
to explain it is to refer to the threefold meaning of yajna:
reverence and worship, socialisation and social service,
and charity including protection and replenishment of
the environment, and then apply those to the seven
stages of existence: Bhuh, Bhuvah, Swah, Maha, Janah,
Tapah and Satyam. This mystique of yajna is described
in detail in the Brahmana works on the Veda and briefly
in the Upanishads, Katha and Chhandogya specially.)

foods, healing herbs and means of comfort for the life

Divinity like a prophet for us without relent or delay.






Men of noble thought and action, who know
the seven streams of light flowing from heaven, who
know the paths of Divine truth and spiritual evolution,
who know the celestial doors of existential wealth and
divine bliss, realise and bring to the earth all good for
the cows, for the mind and senses, message of
knowledge, strength and constancy, and immunity
against suffering, virtues by which the human
community enjoys peace, health and comfort in life.






9. A ye visva svapatyani tasthuh krnvanaso amrta-


Just as all parents abide by their children, men
of noble action abide by the way of knowledge and
virtue for the attainment of the nectar of salvation, the
earth abides by her children with her great virtues and
universal generosity, the mother abides by her children,
the vast heaven abides for the support of her creations,
and the sun light abides by the birds, so do I abide with
life for the sake of good actions in the yajna of life.




10. Adhi Ssriyam ni dadhuscarumasmin divo yadakst


The Immortals, realised souls with the vision

joy, the rays of light and flames of fire: all constantly
revitalise humanity like the light of the dawn
resurrecting life and nature after the cover of darkness.

respect. Such is the ruler.








Holding the world like the brilliant sun, ruling
over the heart like a sincere friend, he closely abides by
the earth. The people of the state live together in unison
like young and brave children of the house living
together in a blessed home. The women are pure and
worthy of praise like wives dedicated to the husband.
Such is the leader.

Cows yearning for their calves and overflowing
with milk in the udders drink of Agni’s law of nature

mountains to the far off seas by the law of Agni.
Sunbeams break the cloud by the law of Agni. (So
should mankind follow nature’s law of generous Agni
in yajna and shower love and favour on all life and the

Ra NU




Just as holy waters go to the sea and the vapours
concentrate in the cloud, so do holy people go to yajna
and to Indra, lord of yajna, and as they see the yajna
spread around from the vedi as shelter of life’s
protection, so they conduct themselves in the tradition
of ancient scholars and go forward to the holiest of the

knowledge, action and devotion, love the divine lord


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 83 339

Indra, lord of yajna, just as you accept the
offerings held in the ladles raised by the wedded couple,

of mind and senses and the joy of life and celestial
vision.








As Atharva, scholar of sustained constancy like
energy in stasis, discovers and creates the prime path of
motion by yajnic research, the noble solar scientist
brilliant as the sun dedicated to his vow rises in
knowledge and discovers the path of the earth. Then
the poetic sage prophetically inspired sings of the beauty
of Venus and satellites born of the sun. And we meditate
and pray for immortality of the state of moksha.

the nation.






Those forces of Indra, the ruler, close together
in contact and unison, of varied forms and colours,
brilliant as sunrays and generous and productive as

universe is created and they remain after the life of one

the things that come into existence at the time of

mother, son, daughter, classes of people etc., go out of
existence to annihilation at the time of pralaya. And yet,
at the time of the next creation, they come into existence

existence, and this flow of existence-non existence
continues for all time, eternally. This flow is eternal.
This flow is called Pravaha. These things are eternal in

existencially. The three, God, soul and Prakrti (nature)

MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 94 397


This Agni is the power for the support of Mitra

Lord of light, justice and generosity, such as you are,

udana energy, Aditi, Mother Nature, the sea, the earth,

Mandala 1/Sukta 95
Agni Devata, Angirasa Kutsa Rshi






Night and day, two different forms of nature,
two divisions of time, two different states of Agni, one
direct, the other reflected, move on with their priest-
like task. Both, co-existent and continuous but
separately, like two women, feed and nurse each other’s
child as their own. In one, the night, the moon grows
on with its inherent character of beauty, peace and bliss,
while the sun in the other, the day, blazes with light and
fire, pure, immaculate, glorious. The sun sleeps at night
and the moon sleeps in the day.



2. Dasemam tvasturjanayanta garbham atandraso




Ten directions of space, young and unaging, and
ever-vigilant, create, produce and manifest this sun,
child of Tvashta, Vayu, cosmic energy. It is of versatile
action and purpose and sustains the various forms of
existence. It is blazing and beautiful, self-refulgent with
inherent glory, glowing and showing among the people,
and the same directions move it around for the
accomplishment of the tasks of creation.






Three manifestations of this Agni shine in
nature, space and time, the womb of the universe: one
is in the oceans, another one is in the heavenly region
of light, and yet another is in the waters in the middle
region. Accordingly, it creates and controls the seasons
in relation to the sun and earth and, in relation to the
earth and her people, it creates the directions such as
east and others.



4. Ka imam vo ninyama ciketa vatso matrrjanayat




Who among you could know this mysterious
nursling of the day and night, the sun born of Agni and


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 95 401


Vayu, cosmic energy, who creates its own mothers, the
day and the night? It is the creature of many forces of
nature and itself the womb of many, being the measure
of physical time and creator of the directions of space.
Great, visionary, and innately powerful, it moves on and
across the regions of water and air in space.






Having entered these directions of space and
the objects therein, it grows and expands. Present within
the oblique and wavy motions of wind, air and the rays
of light, it rises above by its own power. On the rise of
the sun, the day and night split up as if out of fear. The
same split marks the west. And yet the night and day
again nurse the hero of light as a favourite hero.




6. Ubhe bhadre josayete na mene gavo na vasra upa


Both night and day, noble and loving, nurse and
serve the sun, Agni, just as lowing cows stay by the
calves with all their love and care. Of those dedicated
experts of yajna who serve Agni with oblations, he rises
above all who offers the oblations from the south.





7. Ud yamyamiti saviteva bahia ubhe sicau yatate


As the sun, this Agni raises its rays upward as
two arms continuously and, growing awful and blazing,
it joins both the horizons, brightening them both
together. All round it radiates its light as if it offers new
clothes to its mothers, the day and the night or the heaven
and earth which hold the light in their lap.




8. Tvesam rupam krnuta uttaram yat samprncanah
mrjyate dhih sa devatata samitirbabhuva.


When Agni, sunlight, assumes a brighter and
higher form mixing the rays of light and vapours of
water in its own region, then, shining as lord of celestial
light and vision, it purifies the sky, elevates intelligence
and refines knowledge and science, and that state of
intelligence and knowledge is divinely pious and



9. Uru te jrayah paryeti budhnam virocamanam




MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 95 403


Agni, mighty as the sun, the vast expanse of
your sphere travels and reaches across and over the
bright regions of the skies. Bright and blazing with all
your own powers and irresistible modes of protection,
protect and promote us.






Agni as electric power and vital heat of life
creates paths over the deserts and in the skies, makes
waterways to flow with rippling waves, and with bright
rays of light illuminates the earth. It creates all the foods
and vitalities for the internal organs of the living body
systems and vibrates in all the new and upcoming forms
of nature and human generations.




11. Eva no agne samidha vrdhano revat pavaka


These, O Agni, light, life and vitality of the
world of existence, pure and purifying, treasure and

nourishments, light and honour. Thus also may Mitra

the sea and the earth, and the light of heaven and the
electric energy of Agni may shine and make us shine.

Dravinoda Agni Devata, Angirasa Kutsa Rshi

as ever with power and force for the devotee. He bears
the strength, vision and wisdom of the world and helps
the dedicated person to realise the values of life with
waters, energy, intelligence and friendship in the society.
The devas, divinities of nature and humanity dedicate
themselves to Him, lord giver of universal wealth, and
bear on the fire of yajna from generation to generation.


With the ancient and eternal poetry of


omniscience and from the eternal cause, He, the lord of
light, creates these children of Manus, men of thought

creates the regions of light and waters and others such
as the earth. The devas, divinities of nature and the
noblest of humanity, hold on to him and bear on the fire
of yajna from generation to generation, universal giver
as He is.




O grateful and dynamic people, serve and
worship Him, Agni, first and highest of existence,
invoked and loved with homage through yajna,
visualised and realised through vision and
discrimination, manifested in energy and products of
energy, sustainer of all and inspiring all with knowledge.
Devas, divinities of nature and nobilities of humanity,
hold on to Him and bear on the fire of yajna from
generation to generation, universal giver as He is.




4. Sa matarisva puruvarapustirvidad gatum tana-


He, Agni, is Matarishva, universal breath of life
replete in the middle regions of space. He is the
inexhaustible treasure-home of energy and nourishment.
He revealed the Holy Word of the Veda for His child,




the humanity. He is the giver of light and happiness. He
is the protector of the people and creator of heaven and
earth and the skies. Devas, divinities of nature and
humanity, worship Him, universal and generous creator
and giver of wealth, and bear on the fire of yajna from
generation to generation.






The night and the day both of different light and
form like two nursing mothers together feed the same
one child. The child, Agni, the sun, pervades and shines
in heaven and over earth. The devas serve and worship
Agni, giver of universal wealth, and move on bearing
the fire of yajna from generation to generation.




6. Rayo budhnah samgamano vasunam yajnasya


Agni is the foundation and magic mantra of
wealth and power. It is the companion of the Vasus,

yajnic projects of life, and means to the fulfilment of


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 96 407


cherished desires. The seekers of immortality and
protectors of eternal values hold on to this giver of
universal wealth and bear on the fire of yajna from
generation to generation.






Agni is the new as well as the old and eternal
cause and the haven and home of all the material wealth
of the created universe already born and what is
continuously being born. It is the holder, sustainer and
protector of the constant and the mutable forms of the
vast creation. The devas, divinities of nature and
humanity, hold on to Agni in faith and maintain the fire
of yajna from generation to generation, giver of




8. Dravinoda dravinasasturasya dravinodah

Vaishvanara Agni, ruler of humanity and indeed the
spirit and vitality of all life on earth. The ruling power,

this world and acts in unison with the sun and prana.

Lord of intelligence, Indra, acts by the paths of
Rudras, that is, Maruts, powers of law and dispensation
and the process of formation and reformation. With the
Rudras, waves of Maruts’ energy, the dawn expands the
lights of the day. Intelligence and mind invoke the
famous powers of Indra, waves of Maruts, as they act
in thought. That Indra, lord of the Maruts’ motion and
energy in space, we invoke for support as divine friend
and benefactor for progress and prosperity.




8. Yad va marutvah parame sadhasthe yad vavame


Indra, lord of Maruts, tempestuous dynamics of

The power and fame of this Indra, the seven
rivers hold in their flow and reveal. Heaven and earth

the moon shine and move so that we may realise his
glory, have faith, feel the joy of life and finally cross
through the ocean of existence.

3. Tam sma ratham maghavan prava sataye jaitram

Maghavan, lord of power, wealth and victory,
reveal and bring up that wondrous and victorious chariot
of yours for our victory and success in battle which we
celebrate in the contests of heroes. Invoked, praised and
worshipped with our mind and soul for the battles of
life, Indra, give us, who are your admirers, our part of
wealth and comfort.

4. Vayam jayema tvaya yuja vrtamasmakamamsa-


Indra, let us win the prizes of life with your help.
In every battle and in every contest, keep our selected
part and our deserved prize safe. Indra, lord of wealth

and force, break down the storms of enemy power for us.






Indra, lord controller and treasurer of the wealth
of the nation, many people are there, your admirers and
worshippers, who invoke you and call upon you with
means of security and protection. Be seated in our
chariot which is unbreakable and victorious and in
which your mind would be cool, collected and at peace,
and come to assign our share of rights and duties and to
dispense our part of endeavour and prize.






6. Gojita bahu amitakratuh simah karman karman-


Strong armed victor of lands, immensely
intelligent, tactical fighter and winner, protector and
defender in a hundred ways in every battle, heroic
warrior, strongest of the strong, match for the matchless

the world. Him, the men of admiration invoke for
company and protection.




7. Ut te Satanmaghavannucca bhiyasa ut sahasrad


Indra, lord of might and power, more than
your fame and power among the people. Great is your
intelligence and action and noble is your voice which
makes you shine immensely more than brilliant. And
then you break the clouds of rain for the showers and
rout the strongholds of the hoarders.




8. Trivistidhatu pratimanamojasastisro bhumirnr-


Indra, Nrpati, lord of the people and ruler of the


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 102 431


world, in you, threefold is the existence of elements
such as earth, water, fire, air and space, of the order of
matter, motion and mind (sattva, rajas and tamas). You
are the measure of omnipotence. Three are the regions
of space, heaven, sky and earth. Three are the orders of
heat and light, vaishvanara fire in earth, taijasa electric
energy in the sky and Aditya light in heaven. O lord,
Indra, you transcend this entire universe, and by nature
since eternity you are without an enemy, contrariety and




purah.


Indra, lord ruler of the universe, first and highest
among devas, divinities of nature and humanity, greater
than your own attributes, we invoke you, pray to you,
and worship you. In the battles of the elements and
conflicts of humanity, you are the unmoved victor. Lord
Indra as you are, in our yajna of life for progress and
prosperity, we pray, advance our chariot made of earthly
materials to the front and raise our technologist maker
and respected worker close at hand among us to high






10. Tvam jigetha na dhana rurodhitharbhesvaja


Indra, lord ruler of the wealth and power of the
world, you win the battles great and small, and stall not

Varuna, sun and shower, Aditi, saints and skies, Sindhu,
rolling seas and rippling rivers, the earth and heaven
protect and promote this holy programme of ours.


Mandala 1/Sukta 103
Indra Devata, Angirasa Kutsa Rshi


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 103 433




That glory of yours, lord, which is supreme and
eternal, which is essential, subtle and mysterious, and
this which is actual and existential, the poets of vision
and imagination realise by its manifestations. Of this
glory of Indra, this which is on earth is one and distinct,
and the other which is in heaven is distinct and another.
The two mingle in form and mature as one just as two
parties meet in the assembly, each with its identity, and




2. Sa dharayat prthivim paprathacca vajrena hatva


Indra, lord of light and power, like the sun, with
his actions, 1.e., waves of gravitation, holds the earth
and manifests its vast expanse. Striking the electric
thunderbolt of his energy, he constantly creates the
waters of space. He breaks the cloud formed in the
Rohini constellation, striking over its shoulders and
releases the showers of rain on earth.









Indra, lord of knowledge and wielder of the
thunderbolt, sustainer of all that is born, faithful and
valorous, routing the strongholds of evil, roams around.
Heroic Indra, having struck the thunderbolt on the
wicked, develops wealth and valour for the noble ones.




4. Taducuse manusema yugani kirtenyam maghava


Surely that honour and fame for actions, the lord
of power and wealth, Indra, maintains for the admirers
for ages of human memory, which he, wielder of the
thunderbolt, of omnipotence, achieves in action for the
sake of wealth and fame while he advances for the
destruction of the evil and the wicked.






Watch the mighty action, this great achievement
of this lord Indra and take it on with conviction for the
attainment of honour, fame and valour. He develops
lands and cows. He acquires horses and develops modes
of transport and communication. He develops herbs and
trees, creates waters and develops water resources, and
he creates all kinds of wealth and expands the forests.


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 103 435




6. Bhurikarmane vrsabhaya vrsne satyasusmaya


We create wealth and distil the soma-joy of life
for Indra, lord of abundant action, brave, generous and
truly brilliant. Heroic and fearless, he respects the wise
and, like a detective, uncovers the black money of the
hoarders, shares it with the community and moves on.




7. Tadindra preva viryam cakartha yat sasantam


when you take on the sleeping cloud with the
thunderbolt. And then the house-wives, the wise seniors,
and all the noble pious people rejoice with you.





Indra, when you break down Vrtra, the mighty
cloud which can raise green fields of barley and create




prosperity for the farmers, and when you shatter the
deep caverns of Shambara, the dark cloud pregnant with
vapour as if destroying the formidable forts of an enemy,
then Mitra, the sun, Varuna, the oceans, Aditi, the sky,
the rivers, the earth and heaven rise and inspire us with
reverence and faith.


Mandala 1/Sukta 104
Indra Devata, Angirasa Kutsa Rshi




1. Yonista indra nisade akari tama ni sida svano


Indra, this seat of high office is prepared and
reserved for you. Come, take it, rejoicing as a victorious
knight of horse. Come post-haste to join for
refreshments and holy food, leaving behind the birds,
horses and the celestial carriers of the night and day.







Those people who approach Indra for protection
and pray for advancement, he leads, all of them, by the
right path at once and always. May the devas, noblest


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 104 437


powers of nature and humanity, allaying the passion and
fear of the demon of opposition, open the path of
progress and bless us with inspiration and guidance for
onward movement and protection.






The clever financier carries away the wealth of
others for his heart’s desire. He syphons away the
nation’s wealth down to the scum with a passion and
wallows in the milky waters of his bath. But bathed and
anointed with milk, like the rival mistresses of a swindler
both dying of violent jealousy, he would drown in the
whirlpool of the flood of his own creation.




4. Yuyopa nabhiruparasyayoh pra purvabhistirate


The life-string of the people’s energy, like the
centre of the waters of the cloud, is implicit and hidden.
And just as the sun breaks open the energy of the cloud
with its rays and shines, so does Indra, the ruler, with
the people themselves, release that energy and shines
as a hero. And then, just as the straight and rapid, brilliant
rivers fed by the heroic Indra, collecting streams of
water, full to over flowing, move on, so the people,




dynamic and brilliant, protected and guided by the
heroic ruler, grow to their full capacity and, creating
and collecting wealth and power, move on their way.




5. Prati yat sya nithadarsi dasyoroko naccha sada-


Seen is the path, the people know: like the one
to the house of the robber and that which leads to the
house of the good in full knowledge. Indra, lord of
wealth and power, take us not away from the path of
good action, throw us not away like the wealth of a




6. Sa tvam na indra surye so apsvanagastva a bhaja


Indra, lord ruler of light and power, give us the
brilliance of the sun. Give us the coolness and plenty of
waters. Establish us firmly in sinlessness for a full life
of joy. Pray do not hurt our people, they are worthy of
protection. We are dedicated in faith to you for the sake
of wealth and prosperity.

And I believe in you. We have reposed full faith
in you for this life of joy. Great lord of strength and
generosity, inspire us to achieve great wealth and
honour. Honoured and invoked by many, O lord, do not
deliver us, our life and descendants, unto an ignoble
state of existence. Indra, provide ample food and soma
drink for the hungry and thirsty.




8. Ma no vadhirindra ma para da ma nah priya


Deprive us not of our cherished dreams and desires.
Lord of great action and power, wealth and honour,
destroy not the future in the womb. Neglect not those
who deserve, let them not be lost in oblivion. Alienate
not our brethren, descendents and traditions.




9. Arvanehi somakamam tvadhurayam sutastasya


Indra, come right here and now. They say you
love soma. Distilled is the soma of life’s joy, drink of it




to your fill for the bliss of life. Lord of great honour
and universal reverence, invoked by all with love in
faith, listen to our prayers as a father and shower the
rains of bliss.


Mandala 1/Sukta 105
Vishvedeva Devata, Trita Aptya or Angirasa Kutsa Rshi






The moon glides in the middle regions of
Antariksha in the midst of waters and pranic energies.
So does the sun of wondrous rays run fast in the heaven
of light. But the golden-rimmed flashes of lightning
reveal themselves not to your state of consciousness.
May the heaven and earth know the secret of this
mystery and reveal it to men, the ruler and the people.






Those who love things of value get the thing
loves. They vitalise the fluent waters of life, distil the
soma of ecstasy and giving themselves up to the spirit
of life, taste the nectar of existence. O heaven and earth,
know the secret of this mystery of love and life and


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 105 441
reveal it for me.






O divinities of life and nature, may that ecstasy
and bliss of our life never fall below the top of heaven.
May we never suffer frustration in vacuum of the peace
and joy of the soma of existence. Heaven and earth,
know the secret and mystery of living in the state of
bliss and reveal it to me for all, the ruler as well as the
ruled.




4. Yajnam prcchamyavamam sa tad dito vi vocati.


Lord of knowledge, you are the harbinger of
truth and the message of Divinity. I ask you of that
supreme yajna of life’s protection and promotion which
sustains existence. Where is that eternal water and law
of life hidden or gone? Who at the present time observes
that same ancient and eternal yajna and law of life, and
how? May the heaven and earth know and reveal the
truth for us.








O lords of knowledge, who or what are those
divine powers of existence abiding in the light of heaven
by their name, identity and state of being in the three
regions of the universe? Where is the law of cosmic
dynamics of evolution? What is truth and what is
untruth? What is eternal and constant? What is
existential and mutable? What was the first mutation of
Prakrti in the cosmic yajna? What is going to be the last
and closing oblation in the cosmic vedi? May the heaven
and earth know and reveal it for us.




6. Kad va rtasya dharnasi kad varunasya caksa-


O divinities of existence, what and where is the
ultimate cause of the original life and law, what is that
omnipotence? What and where is that omniscient all-
seeing eye that watches the created forms and their
karmic movement? What and where is that awful path
of the great sun by which we may comprehend and cross
the challenges of existence? May the heaven and earth
know of this and reveal the knowledge to me.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 105 443


7. Aham so asmi yah pura sute vadami kani cit. Tam


I am the same who chant some songs of Vedic
adoration at the dawn of the cosmic yajna of the Divine.
And yet the loves and cares of existence overwhelm me
as a wolf pounces upon a deer thirsting for life and
existence. What is this mystery? May the heaven and
earth know and reveal it to me!




8. Sam ma tapantyabhitah sapatniriva parsavah.


The knives and sickles of life all round cut into
my vitals as rival mistresses consume the lover’s heart
and soul. Just as mice eat up the warp and woof of cloth
in the making, so do the cares of life eat away the original
wealth of me who am, in reality, your admirer and
worshipper, O Lord of a hundred yajnas of the universe.
What is this mystery? Let heaven and earth reveal it to
me.






As far as the rainbow lights of the universe




radiate, as far as the five elements, Ahankara, mind-
matter complex and Mahan, first mutation of Prakrti
expand, as far as the five pranas, mind and intellect
energise life, that far exists the sphere of my life’s centre-
hold. The self-realised soul who knows the time past,
present and future upon the instant knows that and
proclaims for the realisation of universal brotherhood
of souls. May the heaven and earth know and reveal the
secret of this universal brotherhood for me.




10. Ami ye pancoksano madhye tasthurmaho divah.


There they are, five generous founts of energy,
water and joy which abide in the great heavens, they
being fire, wind, vapours of water, electricity and the
sun. They are simultaneous, coexistent and worthy of
being researched, analysed and explained by and to the
noblest of generous scholars. May the heaven and earth
know this mystery of nature and reveal it to me.




11. Suparna eta asate madhya arodhane divah. Te


The waves of solar energy abide in the midst of
the sun’s gravity. They being most potent regulate the
paths and velocities of electricity and the formation and

movement of waters. May the heaven and earth know
this mystery and reveal it to me.




12. Navyam tadukthyam hitam devasah suprava-


O men of knowledge and generosity, this new,
laudable, sacred, useful and secret principle of nature’s
truth and law of physical evolution is worthy of study,
discussion and development. The rivers flow and the
sea rolls the waters while the sun creates and expands
the vapours and again sucks up the vapours. This
mysterious cycle may the heaven and earth know and
reveal to us.




13. Agne tava tyadukthyam devesvastyapyam. Sa nah


Agni, scholar of heat and vitality, that laudable
knowledge of yours is worthy of confirmation with
reference to the presence of vitality in various forms of

mysteries of nature and reveal the same to you and me.

and earth know the mysteries of vital fire and reveal the
same to you and me.

Brahma, lord supreme, creates, Varuna, lord of
love and justice, reveals the knowledge and shapes the
man of knowledge who knows the ways of nature and
the ways of the world. We pray to the lord supreme, we
request the man of knowledge. He removes the veil of
ignorance with his heart of love and refines our
intelligence. We pray may new and newer facts of nature
and divine law arise. May heaven and earth know and
reveal the knowledge to us.

That is the path which is blazing glorious as the
sun in heaven, eternal and imperishable, created in the
light of eternal knowledge, Veda, to be meditated on,
spoken of and followed. Not even the greatest in nature
or humanity can exceed or violate it. O mortal men and
women, you do not see it. I pray, may the heaven and
earth know and reveal it to you and me.




17. Tritah kupe’vahito devan havata utaye. Tacchu-


Trita, the soul in possession of simultaneous
vision of past, present and future time, having achieved
efficiency in knowledge, action and prayer, withdrawn
into the cave of the heart, or, even the soul fallen into
disarray in all the three ways and deep in the well of
desperation, calls upon the Lord for succour, protection
and spiritual elevation. The Lord, Brhaspati, lord of the
universe and universal voice, listens and creates a wide
path of freedom from sin, despondency and limitations.
May the heaven and earth know that path and reveal
the words of prayer to me.




18. Aruno ma sakrd vrkah patha yantam dadarsa hi.


The Lord of golden majesty, creator and




measurer of the months of time, giver of vision and bliss
like the moon, watches the wayfarer going on the path
of life created for humanity. And the person so observed,
even a hunchback suffering the worst pains, is reshaped
into form and, thanking the Lord, leaps and bounds on
way to freedom in a state of perfect health. May the
heaven and earth know that path and reveal the vision
divine for me.




19. Enangusena vayamindravanto’bhi syama vrjane


Inspired by this song of divinity sung by the
sage of eternal vision, let us all, children of Indra, be all
ways great and strong and move forward by leaps and
bounds. And may Mitra, the sun, Varuna, the moon,

Mandala 1/Sukta 113
Usha Devata, Angirasa Kutsa Rshi






Here comes this dawn, light of lights, supreme,
wonderful, bright and enlightening, rising and
expanding. Just as the night comes over for regeneration
of the sun, so does it uncover the womb of darkness for
the coming of dawn.






The bright dawn comes shining with light,
bearing the bright sun new born. The dark night leaves
its regions open for the light. Both, like sisters of the
same one brother, immortal, assume their own form of
light, one bright, the other covered and both come in
succession, each retiring and succeeding the other.






One and the same is the path of the two sisters,
which is space, endless and infinite, existentially
speaking, which they follow one after the other as
ordained by the Divine. They neither overlap, nor
encroach, nor clash, nor stand still for a moment. Fixed
and firm, each on its own, and of harmonious nature
are they, although the night and the dawn are of different
forms which are apparently contradictory as light and

inspiring, vast and bright, for the lazy loon oversleeping
or the squint eyed one, for moving around, for enjoyment
of living, for the attainment of desire and yajna, for the
achievement of wealth, for the weak-eyed one, and for
the revelation of things on earth, you shine and wake

O dawn, for governance and administration of
the social order, for food, energy and national prestige,

in life, and for the attainment of the various and versatile
ways of life, you shine, wake up and envelop the worlds
of existence in light and beauty.

world. O dawn, lady of noble good fortune, come here

preceding and the following.








The mortals who saw the bright and blazing
dawn saw the light and passed away. By us too the lovely
and shining dawn has been seen for the light. And those
too who would see the light of life in the dawns that
would follow, would go but with the light of life. (Life
and light thus go together continuously in succession
in the continuum that existence is.)




12. Yavayad dvesa rtapa rtejah sumnavari sunrta


O Dawn, warding off the jealous, guardian of
divine truth and yajna, born of divine truth and cosmic
yajna, harbinger of peace and comfort, high-priestess

come, best and highest of lights, shine, inspire and bless

The admirer, poet of fiery imagination, sings
inspiring songs in praise of brilliant dawn. O Dawn,
lady of light and harbinger of wealth, shine for the
worshipper and give him the light. And give us the health
and age blest with progeny.




18. Ya gomatirusasah sarvavira vyucchanti dasuse


Bright are the dawns, rich in sunbeams and
wealth of cows, creators and inspirers of all the brave
on earth. Generous are they for the man who gives and
sacrifices, giver of horses fast as sunbeams. And when
men of truth and law meditate on them, then, flying as

Rudra, lord eternal of mercy and justice, strike

our hands raised in prayer with holy offerings, we always
invoke you and pray for kindness and grace.






I bring these songs of praise in homage to you,
father and protector of the brave Maruts, heroes of nature
and humanity, just as a shepherd brings milk and curds
to offer to his master. Lord, we pray, give us peace and
joy. Blissful is the vision of Divinity, most beatific.
Therefore we choose to pray for your protection and
guidance, only that and none else’s.

Surya Devata, Angirasa Kutsa Rshi




MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 115 495




Lo! there rises the sun, wonderful image of
Divinity, the very eye of Mitra, heaven, the soothing
cool of Varuna, the waters, and the beauty of the moon.

regions of the sky. It is indeed the very soul of the
moving and the unmoving world.




2. Suryo devimusasam rocamanam maryo na yosam


The sun follows the brilliant and beautiful dawn
just like a youthful lover who pursues his beloved. And
therein, with reference to that, the leading astronomers

The blissful rays of the sun, reddish, various
and wondrous, exhilarating, invigorating overspread the
expanse of heaven and constantly go over the regions


of space across the sky and the earth.




4. Tat suryasya devatvam tanmahitvam madhya


That Lord of the universe, Omnipotent Light of
creation, is the Sun, Savita, who holds and sustains the
light and grandeur of the sun pervading in the world of
action. And it is He who withdraws and folds up the
same divinity and grandeur of the sun. And when the
Lord withdraws the light of the sun, then the Night of
Pralaya absorbs everything of existence into her fold of
darkness. (This is the story of the eternal round of
evolution and involution of the universe.)


When the sun, in the daily round of day-light
and darkness at night, collects the rays of light from
down below then the night spreads her cover of darkness
over all. (This is the story of the daily round of the day-






The Eternal Lord, in order that Mitra and Varuna,
day and night, be seen, creates light and shade and form.
And so, the sun, which is light incarnate, in the close
space of heaven, shows the forms of things. Endless,

hopes and endeavours.

Ashvins, scholars dedicated to truth and
humanity, in the ocean of space where there is no
beginning and no end, where there is no foothold and
nothing to hold with hand, you carry the man of earthly
enjoyment riding the carrier-boat worked with a hundred
propellers to his haven of rest where there is no want,
no pain, nothing beyond desire. That is great, heroic!

16. Satam mesan vrkye caksadanam-rjrasvam tam


If a person were to sacrifice a hundred generous
and creative contenders, meshas, for the pleasure of a
wolfish thief and his wife, even though such a person
were otherwise very intelligent and dynamic, the
fatherly ruler should throw him into the darkness of
prison. And yet, O Ashvins, lovers of ultimate truth,
dispellers of untruth and darkness, generous showers
of bliss, bring the eyes for the waking blind so that he
could see what is real and true and good and be released
from the dungeon of ignorance. (It is better to make the
blind see than keep them in the prison. It is better to
redeem the criminal and the sinner than throw him in
the prison.)






Ashvins, lovers and defenders of truth in the
battle of life and health of the world, let the dawn,
daughter of the sun, arise and ride your chariot drawn
by horses of light and win the battle. Let all the divinities

noble words and acts of wisdom give that sagely vision

lost but then found and then restored to the master.






Ashvins, lovers and defenders of truth and right,
just as a boat is tied and transfixed under water for ten
nights and nine days by an envious person, or it is held
up, or drifts over water, but then is upraised and brought
on the track by a noble ferry man, so if an admirer of
truth and right and devotee of divinity feels supressed
by adverse forces, feels depressed or distempered or
drifts from the right track, then, O Ashvins, give him a
hand and raise him like a soma libation raised in the


ladle ready for offering into the fire of yajna.

Ashvins, noble divinities of truth and right

Rebha, eminent scholar of knowledge and

gold of the earth, and sow the seeds of life, energy and
light so that all may see, honour and admire the grandeur
of existence.






Ashvins, dedicated to truth and nature, leaders
of scientists and pharmacists, that work of yours is of
universal value and worthy of praise by eminent scholars

Ashvins, brave and generous heroes, with your
own powers and plans and with your chariots flying
like birds, take a powerful force to the protector and
defender of the nation gone to a state of isolation, rescue
him and carry him home to the parental seniors and
sustainers of the people. Your support and protection
for the giver of light and knowledge, who is a servant
of heaven, is great and well-known.




Ashvins, brave, generous and friendly heroes,

you as guardians and defenders of the land.




6. Yuvam rebham parisuterurusyatho himena

You rescue the man of faith and prayer from all
round oppression and relieve the thrice free man from

you provide rest and security on earth and you help the
man worthy of reverence to live a long and full life.






Ashvins, heroes of noble action, destroyers of
suffering, with knowledge and admiration you
reinvigorate the noble reverend scholar stricken with

Ashvins, that bee, seeker of honey, in a mood

the head of the seers he would proclaim the Word of
cherished wisdom and enlightenment.

the people can challenge any enemy whatsoever

Ashvins Devata, Kakshivan Dairghatamasa Aushija Rshi

What call, Ashvins, leaders and commanders,
would rouse you to action and victory? Who could, if
he were ignorant and unintelligent, lead you to victory


and win your pleasure, and how? (None of the ignorant
and unintelligent.)








Let the ignorant man and the imperceptive
unintelligent person ask the Ashvins, men of intelligence
and wisdom, the way forward for progress. Similarly
another, the intelligent and the learned person too in
his own way should ask the way forward for further
advancement. In any case, let them ask the way out and
onward for the sake of the man who would otherwise
stand still doing nothing, in the state of doubt and
inaction.



3. Ta vidvamsa havamahe vam ta 110 vidvamsa

The same, Ashvins, harbingers of light and

formulaic structure and formation of things in creation
and science, brilliant veterans, dynamic and tolerant as
well as enduring as you are, both scholars and teachers.
May we offer you homage and reverence, and may you,
we pray, guide and protect us.


Ashvins, harbingers of light and knowledge,
that voice which rings like the resounding proclamation

search of food, energy and light for all of us.

Ashvins, hold us in protection but not for the

Great and glorious is this chariot, comfortable

Mandala 1/Sukta 121


Vishvedeva and Indra Devata, Kakshivan
Dairghatamasa Aushija Rshi






O man, when would you be like Indra, a
protector, ruler, saviour and friend of the people? When,
in order to help and protect the people, you would hear
the voices of the lovers of light and knowledge who are
keen to rise to divinity, when running to join the people
you would reach their homes over the wide earth, and
when you would raise your voice and inspire them in
their yajnic task of love, cooperation and creation as
the performer of yajna yourself.




mataram goh.


Just as Indra, the sun, self-refulgent lord of light
and sustainer of the earth, wields the heaven and showers
the wealth and waters of life for the creation of food
and energy, so should the ruler, luminant with the light
of knowledge and justice and sustainer of the world


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 121 535


system of the earth and environment, uphold Dharma,
justice and rectitude and create the wealth and waters
of stability and progress with nourishment and energy
for the maintenance of the social order. And just as the
mighty sun lights and watches its own creation, the
dawn, beauteous glory of the solar system and nurse of
mother earth, so should the ruler light up and watch the
word of knowledge and the light of justice created by
the social order itself which, in turn, would be the beauty
of the system and sustenance of the order.






Like the sun illuminating the brilliant dawn
every day, let the ruler follow, illuminate and extend
the brilliant ethics and policies of eternal value and
shine, inspiring the best and dearest people, day by day.
Let him have the armaments deployed, serviced and
sharpened and, as the sun holds the regions of heaven,
let him maintain the light of justice for the quadrupeds,
bipeds and humans and all that concerns the humans.




4. Asya made svaryam da rtayapivrtam-usriyanam-


Just as the sun, in the excitement of the morning,




releases the flood-light of its brilliant rays held up at
night for the yajna fire of the day, and, pervading three
quarters of space (leaving off the nether hemisphere of
the earth), returns and stands firm in the battle of light,
and breaks through the gates of the dark enemy forts,
so should the ruler, for the joy and prosperity of the
social order, release his resounding force of light and
power held in reserve for the occasion to extend the
yajna of justice and rectitude and, raising the resources
of eloquent and brilliant teachers, preachers and
scientists, should break down the strongholds of
opposition in the battle for the development of cows
for the white revolution.




5. Tubhyam payo yat pitaravanitam radhah sureta-


O man, when for your sake yajnic people offer
oblations of pure milk and ghrta of the all-blessing cow
as the wealth of their choice, then for you, O living and
vibrant humanity, the brilliant heaven and earth, both
generous givers of health and nourishment like mother
and father, bring you showers of rain full of virility,
fertility and all round success and fulfilment.




6. Adha pra jajne taranirmamattu pra rocyasya


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 121 537


Let Indra, the noble soul, self-redeemer from
suffering, arise, rejoice and shine like the rising sun close
upon the heels of the dawn. Blest with grace like the
beauty of the moon, sprinkling the vedi with ladlefuls
of holy offerings and singing songs in praise of Divinity
by which you attain to the city celestial, let the soul
rise, rejoice and shine.






Noble soul, brave and shining, whatever famous
you have done, whatever preservation of forests or cow
whatever further you wish to do for the sake of transport,
animal husbandary or superfast travel try to do for the
value of love, non-violence and yajna day in and day out.




8. Asta maho diva ado hari iha dyumnasahamabhi


Indra, O ruler, the rays of the sun pervading the
great heaven, reaching here on earth, churn and absorb
the delicious, vitalising fragrances of yajna, soma
strengthened with cows milk and reinforced by the
earth’s energy, and then, swelled up by the wind and
fighting with the clouds rain down showers of wealth


for your growth and advancement.


(So does the yajnic ruler and the pious creative
soul absorb the yajnic production of the earth and society
and returns the same through hundred and thousandfold
production and creation adding thereby to the wealth
and beauty of life.)




0. Tvamayasam prati vartayo gordivo asmanam-


Indra, lord of light, power and justice, you go
round earth and heaven, wielding the thunderbolt made
from steel and stone and tempered with heat and
electricity procured and refined by Rbhu, master of
metals, speed and range. Invoked and invited by all for
the defence of the sagely man of wisdom, you go about
with the fatal weapon striking countless blows upon
the wicked and destructive demons. Lord of light and
force, having used the weapon and achieved the aim,
be gracious and call it back.





Indra, brilliant sun, brave ruler of the world, lord
of mountains and the clouds, as earlier, before the


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 121 539


elimination of darkness, you struck the thunderbolt and
broke the cloud of darkness, so now strike the same
thunderbolt, destroy the power and darkness of the
demon that covers the world unto the borders of heaven,
and restore the light that is blissful and enduring across
the heavens and the farthest quarters of space.




11. Anu tva mahi pajasi acakre dyavaksama mada-


Indra, may the great, protective and irresistible
heaven and earth rejoice with your exploits. With your
mighty thunderbolt of sun-rays you break the inert cloud
of darkness in showers and make it flow in streams of
water as it has been hoarding vapour and then flowing,




12. Tvamindra naryo yan avo nrn tistha vatasya


Indra, first of men, guide and leader of the social
order, manage, protect and abide by those men who,
like children of the wind, are cooperative carriers of
the burdens of the state, and protect and abide by that
impassioned lover of Dharma, son of the wise and poetic
creator, who creates, sharpens and gives to you the




thunderbolt, that invincible weapon of defence and law,
which helps you destroy the enemies of light and leads
you to the delight of victory.




13. Tvam suro harito ramayo nrn bharaccakra-


Indra, bright and brave like the lord of
sunbeams, keep the creative yajnic people happy,
wielding and moving the wheel of the nation like the
moving chariot of the sun. And take the uncreative and
non-yajnics, across the ninety navigable streams and
engage them in labour jobs like digging of wells and




14. Tvam no asya indra durhanayah pahi vajrivo


Indra, lord of light, justice and glory, wielder of
the thunderbolt and mover of the chariot wheels of the
nation, we pray to you, protect us from this difficult
army of evil and this sin in our battle of life and, for the
sake of will and resolution, food and energy, honour
and reputation, truth and justice, bless us with dynamic
experts of motive power and velocity across the earth
and the quarters of space.

life. Lord of noble humanity, bless us with advancement

Lord of grandeur, may we ever enjoy the ecstasy of your
love.

All ye men of high spirit, vibrant as the winds
of earth and skies, along with the brave, ever ready like
the archers of the bow and arrow, bear and offer
nourishing holy food and yajna in honour of Rudra,
generous lord of life and joy. Offer the light of
knowledge to the ignorant suffering in the dark. And
with you all I offer homage to the lord of heaven and


earth and the skies.






Let the dawn and dusk, light of day and peace
of night, clothed in beauty of the sun, beatific with the
rays of light, dressed like a lady of fulfilment in apparel
of golden hue, bearing rich gifts of life and wealth, come
in response to our invitation to yajna with a shower of
light for our growth and enrichment.






May the light of the sun and heat of fire, all
radiating, all consuming and creating, give us joy. May
the winds, harbingers of rain showers, give us joy. May
Indra, cosmic energy, and the clouds, both, sharpen our
intellect, and may He, the Lord Almighty, and all the
generous divinities of nature and humanity bless us with
the wealth and joy of life.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 122 543




For honour and glory with reputable action, I,
child of noble ambition, invoke the two, fire and wind,
one the product, the other, the giver of waters, both
universal and protective as well as promotive of life
and humanity. And I call upon you all: create and
promote the child of waters, the fire energy, and the
mother of waters, the winds.






Listen ye all, scholars of science and technology,
I, son and disciple of the man of knowledge and noble
ambition, call upon you and, like a voice from above,
proclaim the admirable word of the gifts of the heat and
light of Agni in resounding tones: its form and structure,
analysis and break up, its creative re-structure for life-
support and the gifts for the protection and promotion
of life.


6. Srutam me mitravaruna havemota srutam sadane


Listen ye Mitra-Varuna, friends, and all men of




the chosen few, listen well to this invocation and
exhortation, listen ye members of the yajnic assembly

words of one who himself listened well to the voice
Divine, and listen like the river receiving the waters of
rain from above for the onward gift of life and growth
to the fields and the farmers and so on for us.




7. Stuse sa vam varuna mitra ratirgavam Sata prksa-


Mitra and Varuna, lord of light and lord of water,
friends and chosen comrades, I worship you, I honour
you, for the gifts of your power and generosity. The
gifts of your benevolence and hundred voices of the
Divine and a hundred cows of milky nourishment in
the battles of speed and progress are showered on those

Word and chariots of love and beauty, always and
instantly bearing gifts of nourishment and growth, ruling
out all negativities and nonsense.

I honour and admire the wealth and generosity

with noble and brave progeny and friends. I wish the
heroic man of knowledge and the chariot, possessed of
fast conveyances, power and speed, and horses and
horse-power were to share the secret for me.






Mitra and Varuna, lords of friendship and liquid
in crooked ways, whoever does not support you and
life with nourishment and energy, such a man would
himself wear the canker in his heart. But the man of
truth and generosity supporting life all round with love,
charity and sacrifice would be blest with peace and joy.




10. Sa vraghato nahuso damsujutah sardhastaro

such men as he, of power and discipline worthy of
governance, bring the grace of culture and beauty to
the people’s life.

May all the powers of nature and nobilities of

gold and diamond in the neck and ear, and may they
wide open the paths of progress for him and for us. And
may the generous producer of wealth always try to create
the knowledge of living languages of communication
and the wealth of cows for himself and for us all.






15. Catvaro ma masarsarasya Ssisvastrayo rajna


The four classes and the four orders of society
and the three councils of the ruling order, destroyer of
evil, prosperous and victorious may, I pray, protect and
advance me. Mitra and Varuna, friendly ruling powers
of our highest choice, may your chariot, far-reaching,
bright and beaming like the rising sun, shine on and
brighten us up in life.

to our earliest invocation.






O Dawn, high-born of heaven, inspirer of
humanity, whatever share of your generous gifts you
bring here to-day for men, let the divine Savita, best of
men among friends, brilliant giver of life, say of us to
the sun: These are sinless people.


pretation of this mantra: Usha is the bride beautiful as
the dawn, Savita is the groom, Surya is God, and the
‘sinless’ are members of the family. This interpretation
prevails through the whole Sukta.)

The light of the dawn radiates from home to
home gracefully day by day clothed in the beauty and
glory of her own name, inspiring and beatifying, shining

praised, and then hold him who is the supporter of sin
and then we shall catch him with the gift of your light
and win by the chariot.






Let the ladies of high truth and generous


munificence sing songs of Divinity. Let the fires of yajna
shining and blazing stay and go on burning. The brilliant
dawns light up and reveal the cherished wealths of life
hidden in the dark.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 123 551


One goes away at dusk, the other comes over in
the morning, thus the lights of the day-night cycle both
different of form move together and coexist. Of these
two cyclic coexistents of the world, the dark covers and
hides things in the cave, the other, the dawn of light,
reveals them in their true form with the beauty of its
chariot.






They are the same today as they will be
tomorrow, and in the same manner together, both brave
and beautiful, they go round in the region of the sun,
each traversing thirty stages of its travel time ever and
on in the yajnic cycle of their circulation. (Each stage
of time is of twenty-four minutes.)






She knows and reveals the first, morning, part

following her daily chores fixed by nature day by day
and hour by hour, she never relents in her observance
of the Law of the Divine.






10. Kanyeva tanva sasadanan esi devi devamiya-


Sweet and soothing beauteous, unique in form

your bosom for love and adoration.



11. Susankasa matrmrsteva yosavistanvam krnuse


Glorious and comely in appearance, a bride as
if anointed by the Mother, O youthful Dawn, you reveal

glory, and may the sublimity of this glory never fade
but ever abide as now in future manifestations also.

above, descending again for the world, and in the end
transcending the world of existence to nameless Eternity.


13. Rtasya rasmimanuyacchamana bhadrambha-


O Dawn, going round by the light of Eternity in
pursuit of the Law Divine, bring us the bliss of goodness,
give us the vision of truth and beauty and the will to

The Dawn, she appears to stand so close like
the treasure chest of purest sunbeams, open, radiating
and revealing the dearest things like the latest versatile
scholar, giving the wake-up call to the sleeping partners
living and eating together. It appears as if, of all the
dawns coming and rising, she is the most real and
original of the Eternal that has come this morning.






Radiating the rays of light in the eastern half of
the sky, the dawn has unfurled her banner of morning
glory. And sitting as if in the lap of her parents, the
heaven and the earth, she expands the noblest light of



6. Evedesa purutama drse kam najamim na pari




And this dawn most comely to the sight and
blissful to the heart, neither precludes her own nor
excludes the aliens. Similarly, shining unique and
exceptional by her immaculate body of light, she neither
ignores the small nor neglects the great, but shines bright
and smiles equally on all, giving them the feel of bliss.






Just as a brotherless woman returns to her man,
just as a man reduced to aversity goes to the court to
rejoin his money, just as a wife in all her finery, loving
and passionate, opens her secret charms to her husband,
so does the dawn in all her splendour reveal her beauty
and majesty to the world everywhere.




8. Svasa svasre jyayasyai yonimaraigapaityasyah

Of all these sister dawns of the past age, the

bearing the wealth of the world and illuminate our days
with the light of the world.

O Dawn, abundant in light and wealth, wake up
the generous and giving. The miserly and the ignorant

Streams of joy, peace and prosperity flow from

Cows for love of food and care stand round the man
feeding and satisfying the needy. And streams of water,
milk and ghrta flow to the charitable man incessantly
from all round.


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 125 561






The man dedicated to knowledge abides in
inviolable peace and joy. The man who feeds and

men of knowledge and divinity. For him the waters,
rivers and the seas create showers of ghrta, and this earth
with her generosity always creates the joy of fulfilment.



6. Daksinavatamidimani citra daksinavatam divi


For the men of charity and yajna are these

immortality beyond death, in life and after. And the men
of courage, protection, fearlessness and charity cross
the seas of suffering and slavery in their life of full age.








May the generous never come to sin and
suffering. May the brilliant people of holy vows never
suffer the disabilities of old age. May the orbit of their
Karma be something different from evil and pain, since
sorrow and suffering is the lot of the ungenerous and

Noble brethren, I accept and promote the

Agni Devata, Paruchhepa Daivodasi Rshi






I worship, serve and meditate on Agni, lord of
light and knowledge, spirit of life and heat and
inspiration of noble action, yajaka, generous giver,
treasure of wealth and universal shelter, inspirer and
creator of courage and courageous action like the sun,
omniscient lord of all that is born in existence, master




of knowledge as the supreme scholar of the Veda,
organiser of yajna with love and non-violence with
divine knowledge and awareness, refulgent with
heavenly light and power, loving and consuming with
flames of fire and light the blaze of the purest and most
powerful ghrta offered into the fire of yajna, physical,
mental and spiritual all.’




2. Yajistham tva yajamana huvema jyesthamangi-

Agni, lord most worshipful, we the performers
of this yajnic assembly, with all our heart and mind,
together with all the saints and scholars with their earnest
desire, invoke and invite you, wisest and senior-most
of the scholar visionaries of Divinity, pure and
immaculate, brilliant as the sun with your reach into
the light of heaven, high-priest of humanity, lord of light
people accept, respect and approach with their desire
and prayer for protection and self-fulfilment.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 127 567




He surely rises to shine very brilliantly with his
own splendid valour and honour who, like the axe which
cuts down the trees, mows down the enemies, in whose
presence even the strong and firm like the dense forest
burst asunder into pieces, and who, commanding brave
warriors, dominates and directs the enemies and, like a
mighty wielder of the bow and arrow, never wavers but
advances in battle against the enemy forces.




4. Drlha cidasma anu duryatha vide tejisthabhira-


Just as the strong man of prosperity and spirit
of service offers homage to the man of knowledge and
wisdom, so does he offer oblations in yajna to Agni for
the sake of protection and advancement. And Agni too,
arising from the fiery potential of arani wood, gives
protection and advancement to the yajaka. Just as fire
overtakes many thick forests and reduces them to ash
with its flames, so does the commanding yajaka reduce
even strong enemies to naught, and just as the light of
the sun ripens the grain with its energy, so does the
yajaka ripen and strengthen the prosperity of the earth


and humanity.






Let us meditate on and do homage to that
assiduous and uncompromising Agni, leading light of
the world, in all directions, who shines brighter and
stronger at night than in the day and, holding holy
offerings in hand, let us honour and worship him. Just
as a father provides a strong and happy home for the
child so do the unaging leading lights of yajna and
humanity bring us solace and protection with the
gracious judgement of the dedicated and the
undedicated. And thus, let us too, unageing and bright
like the fire, live long and happy.

MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 127 569


That Agni, daring and roaring as the wind, is
admirably fearsome in raging battles, as he is worthy of
honour and homage in yajnas in lands fertile as well as
deserts and among families blest with lovely children.
He receives offerings with love, readily consumes and
uses the same for creative purposes. Indeed he is the
triumphal banner of yajnas, most worthy of honour and
worship. And of course all the people, joyous and
emanating joy all round, follow in his footsteps, follow
him on the path shown by him for the pursuit of
goodness, beauty and joy of life.




7. Dvita yadim kistaso abhidyavo namasyanta


When the Bhrgus, dedicated seekers and
worshippers, generous members of the community,
brilliant scholars, faithfully take on Agni for study and
meditation, two ways in theory and practice, vision and
pursuit, speak of it in detail analysing and realising it,
then Agni, pure and immaculate power, wise and
intelligent, that rules the wealth of the world and is the
very foundation of these, blesses the darling dedicated
servants with beauty, wealth and success.





8. Visvasam tva visam patim havamahe sarvasam

We invoke, invite and do homage to you, Agni,
lord protector of all the people of the world, for the
light of life. We invoke and do homage to the lord
protector of the home and family equally for all the
people, for the joy of family life. We do homage to the
lord of the voice of omniscience for the joy of
knowledge. We do homage to the lord as the guest of
honour and fire of yajna for all the people, in whose
presence, as in the presence of the father, all these
seekers of freedom and immortality hope for the food
of life, and in whose honour they offer food and
oblations to the brilliant and generous divinities of
nature and humanity.

MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 127 571


Agni, lord of light, knowledge and power, by
courage most courageous of the brave and victorious,
you rise most brilliant and fiery for the advancement of
the noblest powers of nature and humanity, just as wealth
is most effective for the service of the divines. Most
brilliant is your light of joy, most abundant in the service
of yajna. Lord of light immortal, servants of yajna most
obedient and willing, serve you just as they would serve
the Immortal Lord of life.






May your song of praise in honour of Agni,
victorious by virtue of great valour, light of the morning
such as the dawn, be as it should be for the lord giver of
life’s wealth. Just so it is that the yajnic faithful offers
oblations to the eternal teacher of revelation anywhere
in all lands, and how an admirer ever offers praise to
the eminent among scholars, or an aged yajaka offers
to the senior physician.






11. Sano nedistham dadrsana a bharagne devebhih

When a person joins the blazing flames and
forces of this Agni with his gift of oblations and energy
by the yajna of creative and defensive action, as you
would enhance the energy of a vigorous man with
refreshments or you augment the force of the winds,

of the world, protects us against scandals of the envious,
saves us from evil and redeems us from sin and fall off
from Divinity.

hate and enmity toward us and does sinful acts against
us. Listen lord, since you are the closest listener. Let
the man of evil intention be off from our way like one
broken by evil. Let all evil intentions and evil designers
be off and away from us.

guided and protected by you and your power and


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 132 595


potential, let us face the men in the very first encounter,
love, tolerate or fight who wish to love, contest or fight,
and let us win the encounter. On this day right now at
the closest, speak to one and all of those who are
conducting the yajna of the business of corporate living.
In this yajna of full measure, while we are up and doing
and winning all round, let us choose the best meritorious
line of action and let us choose you as our guide, leader
and protector.




2. Svarjese bhara aprasya vakmanyusarbudhah


In the yajnic battle for the winning of light and
joy, in the chant of the Apri hymns for divine favour, in
the holy performance of the person rising at dawn, in
the instant action of the man of love and grace, Indra
destroys the obstacles in the way of action and
achievement for the man who knows the favours of the
lord, and for these the lord is adorable for every one
and for the best among us. Just as Indra is favourable
thus, so we pray to the lord: With us and for us as you
always are, may all your gifts be for our good. May
your gracious favours be good to the noble humanity.








Indra, that Word of yours, that gracious gift, as
ever, is brilliant. You are the ocean of Rta, eternal light
and law of the truth of existence, the very home from
where it flows like a river, like the radiation of sunlight.
Pray speak of that same Word, reveal it in the yajna
where they have created the choicest altar for your
presence. Surely the same light the dedicated yajnics
see within by the divine rays within and without. And I
too would know of it then and realise. Truly Indra is the
giver of knowledge, the Word, the cows and earthly
wealth. He is the giver of these for the lovers and friends
of our brethren. (The seeker of these too is Indra among

Indra, surely the word which you thus reveal
as before for the scholars dear as the breath of life, and
the way you open the doors of knowledge and treasures
of the world, teaching us the wisdom of eternity is worth
admiration and celebration. You fight for us and win
the victories in the same constant way for these and for
us who distil the essence of things. Heat up and season
those indisciplined and lawless people who are funny,
angry, violent or thievish, yes, subject them to the
crucibles of law and education and cleanse them to
purity from culturelessness.




5. Sam yajjanan kratubhih sura tksayaddhane hite


When Indra, brave and fearless lord of power
and glory, by virtue of his wisdom and noble actions,
closely surveys the forces of the people at the call of
battle, the people, keen for honour, in love with fame,
overcome all opposition, worship him and serve him
with all their valour and lustre in the hour of crisis. They
augment his life and morale as the hero of a mighty
nation. Firm of mind and full of confidence, they repose
complete faith in him as in the divinities and find their
haven and home in him.






6. Yuvam tamindraparvata puroyudha yo nah


You both, Indra and the forces, like lightning
and the mountain, fighting in the forefront, destroy with
the thunderbolt everyone whosoever come to attack and
fight us, see that they are destroyed first to the last,
whosoever it be, even running far away for cover or
even if one has gone deep into the bunker. O lord of
valour and lustre, router of the deadly forces, destroy

and cooperative action. I subject the elements of hate
and chaos to the heat and power of law and discipline

and burn off the anti-Indra forces on earth to naught.
And having thus seized and crushed the unfriendly
elements wherever they happen to be active, and
confirmed that they are dead and gone, I let them lie
asleep in their grave.



2. Abhivlagya cidadrivah Sirsa yatumatinam.


Indra, lord of yajna, power and law, firm as rock
and generous as cloud, having caught the lawless and
the violent by the head of the evil-minded, crush them
under the wide wide foot, crush them by the rising forces
of the youth.





Indra, maghavan, lord of world power and
wealth, break down and destroy the force of the evil-
minded and throw them out deep into the vault of
darkness, into the hideous world of sin and death.

4. Yasam tisrah pancasato’bhivlangairapavapah.


Indra, now that you have routed the three times




fifty forces of those agents of hate and violence by your
tactics of seizure and attack, that act excites holy
admiration and celebration, hearty admiration and
reverence.

Indra, destroy the fierce ogres of the lance of
red blood and root out the demons all over.

Indra, lord of earth and heaven, bring down that
fierce demon and break him to pieces. Listen to our
prayer. Purify and let the earth shine like heaven with
tremendous light, lord of clouds and mountains, let the
earth shine with the rule of law as by the blaze of light,
lord of earth and heaven. Lord of highest power, you
move on wielding the most powerful and lustrous
weapons of law and punishment. Gracious and non-
violent with noble humanity, quiet, unseen and brave,
you move with thrice seven heroic purities of existence,


MANDAL - 1/SUKTA - 134 601


O noblest lord, with the purest and holiest verities of
life.




The yajamana who performs yajna and distils
the soma prays for a home and gets one. Organising the
yajna and the distillation of the soma of joy and
prosperity, he drives away many envious enemies by
yajna, drives the enemies of noble people away. The
organiser of yajna, fast, intelligent and wise, open, free
and fearless wants to create a hundred things, and Indra,
lord of creation, power and generosity creates and gives
blissful wealth for the yajnic people, yes, the lord blesses
with the gift of wealth, peace and joy.

dynamic people exerting for advancement achieve
divine protection and success. Only the intelligent ones
working together in unison with yajna and divine energy
receive and reveal the power and wisdom for the
generous yajamana.




MANDAL - 1/SUKTA - 134 603




Vayu yokes the red and the orange red of nature’s
powers such as fire and light, and it inspires the dawn
and the sun. It uses all the dynamic sources of energy
and power such as air and wind, fire and sunlight, the
mind and senses, and the flow of water, all strongest
and most impetuous for transport and communication.
It awakens them and yokes them to the chariot of cosmic
movement. O Vayu, come and wake up and energise
life like a lover who wakes up and impassions a sleeping
beauty. Light up the heaven and earth, light up the
dawns. Light up the dawn of new life and let it rise to
the top of glory.

For you, O Vayu, Divine Energy, the purest and
brightest blissful lights of the dawn in far off spaces
wondrously weave the designs of world beauty in
sunlight, in the newest colourful rays of light. For you
the all generous cow produces all the milky wealths of




food and energy, the divine voice of universal potency
brings all the wealths of world knowledge. For you do
the winds unborn drink up the vapours from the flowing
streams of water and yajna fragrances, and then from
heaven shower the rain of water, energy and bliss for
the world.






The brilliant, pure and radiant, fast and zealous,
and the blazing geniuses in the ecstasy of meditation,
in the rapid flow of their karmas have desire only for
you, have love but only for you in the intensity of their
karma and devotion. The man of strength and generosity
going by safest high ways worships you, lord giver of
wealth and power of the world. You alone, by Dharma
save from all the evils of the world, you alone help us
cross through the world through Dharma.

session and assimilated, grows manifold in the session.
By the mouth and tongue (speech) of another, the
teacher, and with the mouth and tongue of others (his
colleagues), through discussion, the strong and
victorious scholar warding off difficulties and




challenges in the company of others refines and shines
all those who love and admire him.






Both the mothers of this Agni, 1.e., the mother
and the guru-mother of the scholar at school, both equal
in ambition, rising to the clouds in hope, vibrate in
ecstasy like the two arani woods which produce the fire,
and look forward to the success of their child speaking
boldly, destroying the darkness of ignorance and
acquiring knowledge, being reborn fast, worthy of the
company, joy and honour of his father, but carefully to




4. Mumuksvo manave manavasyate raghudruvah


All lovers of liberation, dynamic pioneers,
explorers of the unknown paths of the world, smartest,
diverse minded, fast and wind-inspired, shooting to the
goal at the speed of light join on the yajna vedi with the
man of thought for the man of self-esteem and honour.


MANDAL - 1/SUKTA - 140 629




nanadat.


When this Agni, mighty hero of light and power,
goes forward blowing, roaring, thundering and striking,
covering and vitalising this great earth all round, then
those warriors of his, men of action, advance at will
destroying the monstrous ways of darkness and creating
mighty forms of life and social structure.



6. Bhusan na yo’dhi babhriusu namnate vrseva




Graceful among the old sages, he excels, doing
reverence and homage bowing down. Like a virile
husband going to meet his wife, he moves and speaks
loud and bold among creative women dedicated to pious
and holy yajna. Like a man of light and power, he
appears in brilliant form. Like an awful lion difficult to
with his knowledge and power at the peak.








Covering or expanding, Agni, the brilliant
scholar, covers and seizes things and subjects well,
intensively as well as extensively, and vitalizes them.
Knowing well, he always associates with those who are
knowledgeable, and they, in association with him,
growing higher and higher, assume a divine from and
thus create a personality different from the personality
of their birth.




8. Tamagruvah kesinith sam hi rebhira urdhvas-


The leading lights speak of Agni like flames of
fire and sing of him, and if they ever go down weak and
enervated, they look up to him for fresh life, and Agni,
releasing them from their weakness and enervation and
recreating a high order of fresh vitality and new life,
helps them stay up on high as before and goes forward
roaring and crackling as ever.








Touching and playing with the upper green
garments of mother earth, going fast with resounding
living beings, bearing foods and health and vitality for
the moving multitudes on earth, always following the
paths it came by, Agni goes on leaving behind a reddish
white trail of its visit.




10. Asmakam-agne maghavatsu didihyadha svasivan


Agni, shine among our great and powerful
people, and then, breathing, panting, blowing and
bellowing like a bull, overflowing with energy,
commanding and restraining, dear to the families but
blazing in the battles, protect women, children and the
homes like an armour, throw out the enemy and shine
and brighten up life all around.



11. Idamagne sudhitam durdhitadadhi priyadu




Agni, may this mind and song of ours composed
with love and dedicated in faith be dearer to you than




the dearest song composed with the greatest effort for
you, and may the splendour of your person which blazes
pure and sacred be auspicious for us by which you bring
us precious jewels of life.




12. Rathaya navamuta no grhaya nityaritram


Agni, lord of light, fire and knowledge, for our
chariot-car and for our home, give us the power fitted
with life-time mechanism for propulsion, steering and
measuring the depth of water, a transport which may
take our brave heroes, leaders of power and men of
wealth, and the people across the rivers and seas and
which may provide for peace, protection and a






Agni, lord of light and knowledge, accept our
song and raise our sacred action so that the heaven and
earth, the rivers and seas and the dawns, all self-moved,

of cows and plenty of milk, lot of food grains and the
best of jewels for long long days to come for a full and




Mandala 1/Sukta 141
Agni Devata, Dirghatama Auchathya Rshi






Truly thus, by the grace of Divinity, is radiated
and received the wonderful splendour of Agni’s glory,
and therein lies the seed, the birth, the very life of the
strength and victory of our soul’s existence: therefrom
is the light radiated and received for the beauty of our
embodied soul so that even if our mind ever deviates
from truth, the voices of Law and Truth of Eternity ever
resounding, ever flowing with currents of nature’s light,
call us back to the right path and, thus beatified, our
mind achieves the success we want.




2. Prkso vapuh pituman nitya a Saye dvitiyama


The eternal Agni, which nourishes and matures
the body of life with food, lives in the physical body (as
vital heat and abides with the earth). The second form
of it abides in the seven motherly forms of nature (which
are the seven lokas bhuh, bhuvah, svah, maha, janah,




tapah and satyam), which empowers seven grades of
natural energy, and matures the seven grades of natural
life. The third form of this generous divinity which
matures and distils the essences of natural life abides in
the sun. And the form which energises ten intelligential
faculties (five senses of hearing, touch, sigh, taste and
memory and imagination, ahankara or sense of identity
consciousness, and the soul, the dynamic spirit), young
mothers with love bring into the living world.




3. Niryadim budhnanmahisasya varpasa isanasah


Brilliant scholars of commanding eminence
from the middle regions of the light of the great sun
collect the vitality and convert it into ripening waves
for the maturity of grain. Similarly the vision of the
yogis collects the spiritual vitality of the honey sweets
of heavenly light unto itself in communion and the
pranic energy churns the latent spirit in the depths of
the soul to join it with the heavenly light.




MANDAL - 1/SUKTA - 141 635


The food and nourishment which is collected,
received and assimilated from the highest light of heaven
and the middle regions wonderfully rises and grows into
the hungry herbs and trees and vegetation. And when
both nourish the yajamana and his progeny, the person
grows most youthful, kind and compassionate, and
brilliant and pure.



5. Adinmatrravisad yasva Sucirahimsyamana urviya


In the course of evolution, Agni, the vitality of
life, which enters the mother forms of nature, now
grows, pure, brilliant and unhurt, with the soil of its
germination and generation, and then, the one which
grew on the earlier one with the earlier forms of life,
self-impulsive with the eternal will to live, now lives,
vibrates and runs in the latest and most delicate mother



6. Adiddhotaram vrnate divistisu bhagamiva papr-


Yajnic lovers, admirers and worshippers of
Agni, light and life of the world, choose, invoke and




invite this lord of life and yajnic evolution of nature
and humanity in their cherished holy projects and offer
hospitality and gifts of oblations to it as to the lord of
world wealth and power. And then this lord, worshipped
and favourable by pious acts and power joins the noble
humanity in many many ways to the devas, divine and
generous powers of the universe, for sustenance and
progress under the divine eye.






When Agni, light and fire of life, conducting
the yajna of existence, inspired and impelled by winds,
blazing eloquent like a poet singing in praise of his
patron undisturbed, rises to a state of stability and
omnipresence, then the path of this blazing power going
over areas of darkness, pure and immaculate by birth
shining everywhere across the wide ways of space is
worthy of praise and following by all humanity.



8. Ratho na yatah sikvabhih krto dyam-angebhir-


As a chariot created by scientists and driven by




expert drivers flies across the sky with the brilliant parts
of the machine, so does Agni rise across space with its
blazing flames of fire. Lord of life and light, enlighten
the ignorant, light the paths of darkness, and strengthen
your warriors because, otherwise, at the blaze of fiery
violence like the terror of a demonic hero, life flies away.






Agni, lord of light, life and power, it is by you
that Varuna, the sea as the sky holds on to its law, Mitra,
the sun, dispels the darkness, and Aryama, the abundant
and dynamic nature and the philanthropic humanity are
creative and generous. For the reason of your nature
and divine action, you are universal, omnipresent, and
omnipotent over all and you manifest as immanent and
concurrent just like the rim of a wheel holding the spokes
together running and working together.




10. Tvamagne Sasamanaya sunvate ratnam yavistha

Agni, ever young beyond age, for the creative
man of active piety and worship, you bring the universal




wealth of Divinity in meditation. Lord of power and
youth, wealth and value of the universe, eternal and ever
new, such as you are, in every act of our life we worship
you as the lord and master of the power and glory of the



11. Asme rayim na svartham damunasam bhagam


Bountifully you create and augment for us the
wealth of life good enough for success and value with
honour and discipline of mind and character. Give us
the expert as well as the man of wealth and power to
stabilize and maintain the balance of power and
discipline, law and freedom, individual and society. Lord
controller of both our life here and hereafter like the
rays of light, you who hold the reins of our thought and
action like the reins of a chariot, lord and master of all
noble acts of yajna, pray come and accept the homage
of worship of the dedicated people.

lovable, lead us well to the good life and good fortune
by the most virtuous thoughts and actions of faith and





13. Astavyagnih simivadbhirarkaih samrajyaya


Thus is Agni, wielding power and splendour for
world governance, praised with songs of success and
thankfulness. And thus the yajakas and we, celebrants
all blest with wealth and power by the Lord’s grace,
raise our songs of adoration to the skies loud and bold
as thunder of the clouds under power of the sun.


Mandala 1/Sukta 142
Agni and others Devata, Dirghatama Auchathya Rshi




Agni, light of life and life of the universe, the
fire is burning. Bring the devas here and now, let the
sages come and let nature bless the yajamana who has




raised the ladle to offer the oblation. Expand and
continue the ancient line of yajnic action and progeny
for the generous yajamana who has distilled the soma
for the sages and for you.





Agni, light and spirit of yajna, protector and
preserver of the body, you are the measure of yajna and
with your presence bless the ghrta-sprinkled honey-
sweet fragrant yajna of the adoring generous sagely

Agni, pure and purifier, wonderful of nature,
character and action, is keen to sprinkle yajna thrice
with honey-sweets of fragrance from the light of heaven.
Adorable is he among men, brilliant and generous
among the nobilities of humanity, worthy of company
and honour at yajnas.






Agni, leading light of life and the world, praised

wondrous, versatile and dear lord of honour and power,
and bless us with wealth and prosperity. Lord of blissful
voice and word, thus does my mind and understanding
speak well of you and to you in adoration and prayer.






The organisers of great yajnas of love and non-
violence collect the holy grass, spread it on the vedi
and hold the ladle in hand for the oblation in yajna in
honour of Indra for the sake of power, wealth and
knowledge. And they build the largest home for the
scholars of divinity and, through yajna, divest
themselves of misery and poverty.



6. Vi Srayantam-rtavrdhah prayai devebhyo mahih.

In order to rise to the brilliance of the sages and
towards the heights of divinity, take recource to the
veteran pioneers of Truth, pure purifiers of the spirit,

universally loved and wanted, and join their paths of
action like entering the doors of Divinity.







Bright and blissful cyclic sisters, night and day,

MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 143 645


I bear and offer the highest, latest, joyously
celebrative and most sacred worshipful homage in words
of adoration to Agni, created of might, who is the grand
child of waters of the skies, dearest favourite with the
Vasu order of scholars, receiver and performer in yajna
corresponding to the seasons and abiding with the earth.




2. Sa jayamanah parame vyomanyaviragnira-


That refulgent Agni born of the highest cosmic
space manifested itself in energy currents in the middle
region of space in the skies. It is by the action and force
of this blazing power that the heaven is lit bright and
the earth shines on in beauty.






The beams and brilliance of this holy light, clear
and discerning of sight, beautiful of form and blazing

mighty power of light flowing like rivers in flood are
ever youthful, ever wakeful, they ever shine and dispel
darkness as the dawn dispels the night.

That Agni whom the Bhrgus, men of vision and

and prana, that omniscient Agni, light of the world, with
your words of prayer, invoke and realise in your own
heart and home, yes, Him who alone by Himself is lord
of the wealth of the universe and shines over all as








Agni is a mighty power which, like the roar of
winds, like an awful force launched upon the enemy, is
irresistible just like the thunderbolt of lightning in the
sky. With its dreadful jaws, or crushing weapons, sharp
and destructive, it eats up and destroys as a mighty
warrior destroys the enemies, or as the conflagration
burns up and reduces the forests to ash.


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 143 647




6. Kuvinno agnirucathasya virasad vasuskuvid


May Agni, lord of light and power, expand and
heighten our song of praise and celebration. May the
brilliant power, great and beneficent, accord, approve
and accomplish our desire and ambition with comforts
and well-being in life. Great inspirer is Agni. May the
power sharpen and activate our mind and intellect to
create new things with acquisition of success and
victories. With the same mind and intellect we praise
and celebrate the grandeur of Agni, mighty, versatile,
brilliant, blazing and pure of form and action.






The scholar of brilliance and intelligence
researches and develops agni for you, agni, a power
rising with flames of ghrta, firmly active like a friend
of light and truth, sitting and working for humanity
against the forces of falsehood, darkness and
lawlessness. Blazing unresisted, it shines in the yajnic
projects of development, and inspires and sharpens our


pure and transparent intelligence.

sate.


The yajaka who holds his clear and brilliant
intelligence high with his will and power goes by the
law and discipline of this Agni, light of the Divine power
of the world. He moves forward to hold the sacred ladles




dedicated to the service of yajna-fire and right
circumambulation of the vedi, ladles which first and
directly reach and take the yajamana to the sacred abode
of Agni, light Divine.






Waves of fragrance, streams of nectar, dynamics
of Truth and divine Law, returning, abiding, enveloped
in light, going round Agni in the seat and home of the
lord, the sun, do sing in adoration of the Divine. They
nestle in the womb of the divine mother of waters,
creativity of cosmic energy there held by the mother,
and then the streams of nectar are distilled and rain down
again in showers for the life of the earth and her children,
joining, again with agni, electric energy.






When two persons of equal age and equal mind
wishing to cross over a common problem and achieve a
common end, join together in body for mutual love and
support, they accept, hold on and support each other as




beauty and majesty and accept a tribute of love as fire
accepts an oblation of yajna from us, or as a charioteer
accepts and holds the reins of the horses.




4. Yamim dva savayasa saparyatah samane yona


When two persons of equal age, the wedded
couple, living together, the two as one in the same one
body, in the same one house, serve and worship the same
Agni in love day and night, then the same old eternal
Agni, ever vibrating in the human soul as the will to
live and generate, unaging, for ages and ages, is reborn
as new and young as ever in the human form.






All the human potentials such as thoughts, ideas,
reflection, wisdom, will and understanding, intention,
devotion, prayer and meditation, all ten senses of
perception and volition, the five main pranic energies
and five sub-pranas, though separate, yet jointly, invoke,
enlight and serve the same one Agni as the ten fingers,
though separate, yet jointly, nurse the same one baby
with love and care. We all mortals serve, adore and




worship the same eternal light of life, Agni. It moves
ever so fast and hits its targets as an arrow shot from
the bow, and ever new born and growing, young and
youthful, it receives new knowledge from the sages on
the move. Homage to the Lord for protection,
promotion, peace and well-being!




6. Tvam hyagne divyasya rajasi tvam parthivasya


Agni, light supreme and power, you light and
rule the heavens. You enliven and rule the earth and the
earthly like a master shepherd with love and care. And
both of them, heaven and earth, move on, mighty, grand
and graceful, golden rich and beautiful, rotating and
revolving in their orbits, rushing on and participating
in the cosmic yajna.






Agni, be pleased, listen to our words of praise
and prayer and respond, charming lord of light possessed
of innate power, born of cosmic energy for the law and
truth of existence, master of yajnic action, universally




kind and favourable as you are, celestial beautiful to
the sight, joyous and brilliant of word, and a haven of
peace and comfort like a generous man of hospitality
for all.


Mandala 1/Sukta 145
Agni Devata, Dirghatama Auchathya Rshi






Agni is the lord of light, knowledge and power:
of him they ask the questions, he goes all round, he
knows, he has the wisdom and awareness and the
knowledge of sciences, he reaches, yes, reaches
anywhere he wants. In him lies the power of governance
and law, in him lies the potential for all you want, and
he is the master, ruler and commander of energy, strength
and valour, and of the fiery forces of his dominion.







Agni is the lord of knowledge and self-
realisation: of him the learned ask the questions where


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 145 653


they miss the light, not all, everybody doesn’t ask him.
Lord of peace and stability of mind as he is, whatever
he realises or understands with his own mind is not
subject to doubt either before or later. Everybody goes
by the words and holy actions of this power of undaunted
spirit and undisturbed mind free from arrogance.






Just as ladles of ghrta reach agni, fire of yajna,
so do youth of noble speech and blessed intelligence
reach Agni, lord of brilliance and exalted soul, bearing
questions and homage. May the lord, sole master of
knowledge, unique and unparallelled, listen to my
prayers and questions too, lord inspirer of many, instant
saviour of the seekers, master of yajnic accomplish-
ments, giver of faultless protection, dispeller of doubts
and darkness, all-great and loving, gracefully receiving
and acknowledging questions as well as the homage of

4. Upasthayam carati yat samarata sadyo jata-




When the devotee approaches this brilliant Agni
with holy offerings, it instantly responds, rises, grows
and expands with its flames. When the maidens with
love and faith approach it, it provides soothing touches
of caress and reflection for their peace and joy in a state
of tranquillity.






That Agni which is ever on the move like a deer,
worthy of research and attainment, abiding in the waters,
in the forests, in the sunbeams, in the woods, in the
skin, and in the dark of the eye, which is a metaphor of
omnipresence and universal eloquence of its presence
for humanity, and similarly for the brilliant scholar
dedicated to Agni, abiding for all everywhere, collecting
the dynamic flow of knowledge and speaking of it to
humanity — that is true, that is abiding: Agni,
knowledge, scholarship, the flow, dynamics of
existence, and living.

MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 146 655


Invoke and celebrate Agni, three-headed, seven-
rayed, perfect, nestled in the lap of its parents, which
pervades and fills the lights of this moving but stable
heavenly solar system of the universe.


(Agni is the life-energy of light and heat, born
of akasha and vayu, cosmic space and cosmic energy;
it abides on top of the three regions, earth, middle region
of the skies, and the high and heavenly regions of the
sun. It also abides in the three modes of nature, Prakrti:
sattva, rajas and tamas. It is an integration, or call it the
seed, of the seven rays of light-spectrum, and it energises
all the moving but stable solar systems of the universe.


Agni also is the vital spirit of the articulation of
cosmic awareness in language form in the Veda, which
is learnt from the opening word of the Rgveda. It abides
on top of the three tenses and three persons of the verbs
of the linguistic structure and in the seven vibhaktis,
case endings, and sung in the seven metrical forms and
seven notes of music.


Agni thus is the divine attribute of the spirit at
the individual as well as the cosmic level, and energises,
inspires and illuminates the physical, mental and
spiritual worlds in the spheres of matter, motion and







The mighty sun, far greater than the earth and
other planets, generously radiating floods of light and
waves of gravitational energy, holds the earth and skies.
Ever young and awfully moving, it is stable, providing
protection and stability to its family. On top, it maintains
its degree and distance from the earth while its light
rays touch and drink up the reservoirs of water.






Two cows, the earth and the sun, beautiful and
co-existent, tending the same calf, the day-night cycle,
go round and round, sustaining and revealing the great
banners of the identity of various objects in space.




4. Dhirasah padam kavayo nayanti nana hrda

Veda and the yajna of Truth, Law and divine knowledge?








Agni, lord of light, master of your own power

I bow to your body, mind and soul.






Agni, lord of light, power and knowledge, the
flames of your fire, brilliant teachers and warriors, are

Agni Devata, Dirghatama Auchathya Rshi






Agni! Mighty is he, lord and protector of wealth.
Ruler of rulers, abundant and gracious giver of wealth,
he comes to us to give us of his gifts. And when he
comes near, mountains quake in fear and clouds shower
in rain with reverence.




2. Sa yo vrsa naram na rodasyoh Sravobhirasti


Abundant and generous is he like the clouds of
rain, who, in the midst of heaven and earth as amidst
humanity, has drunk deep of the joy of creation, and,
dynamically pervading the universe with his majesty,
who abides at the centre of the form and identity of






Agni, who has illuminated the celestial city of
this imperishable soul, who is fast as the winds of space
and faster than sunbeams, is the visionary creator of
the worlds of eternity, blazing as the very soul of a



4. Abhi dvijanma tri rocanani visva rajamsi Susu


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 150 663


Twice born and born of two, akasha and vayu,
manifesting in universal nature and in every distinct
form of nature, illuminating three lights, fire of the earth,
lightning of the skies and lights of heaven, vitalising
all the worlds of the universe, Agni abides all round
everywhere. Worthiest universal yajaka, holding the
worlds unto itself, it abides coexistent with the universal
liquid energy of the cosmos.




5. Ayam sa hota yo dvijanma visva dadhe varyani


Such is this Agni, creative lord of cosmic yajna,
wielder of the worlds, born of two and twice born, who
holds the choicest foods, energies and honours of the
universe. And the man who, self-sacrificing, twice born
of natural mother and mother Sarasvati, blest with the
richest gifts of food, energy and honour, with a noble
family gives in homage and surrender to this Agni, he
is the real man.


Mandala 1/Sukta 150
Agni Devata, Dirghatama Auchathya Rshi


1. Puru tva dasvan voce ’riragne tava svida.


Faithful and dedicated, giving in homage, I sing
profusely in honour and celebration of you, and come




in to you for shelter and protection, Agni, lord of light
as the sun, great and glorious.



2. Vyaninasya dhaninah prahose cidararusah.


And I would not care to join the company of the
admirer of the rich not dedicated to the divinities and to
the lord of light, Agni, even though he be otherwise






O lord of light and generosity, Agni, surely that
mortal is blest and brilliant like the moon in the heavens,
great and greater, ever rising most high, who is
worshipful and gives in charity with thanks and divine
admiration. May we, we pray, be dedicated to you,
singing songs of devotion in admiration of the Divine.


Mandala 1/Sukta 151
Mitra-Varuna Devata, Dirghatama Auchathya Rshi




MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 151 665


Agni is dear as a friend and adorable (since it is
the vigour and vitality of life in the human personality,
in the animal world and in the earth and the
environment). Let the people dedicated to the welfare
and protection of humanity, who love the wealth of cows
and milk products, who want to preserve the earth and
the environment, and who value the vitality of their
sense and mind, light and develop Agni, as a dear
adorable friend, with noble acts in yajna and corporate
action to inspire vitality in the cows, in the pranic
energies, in the mind and senses, and in the earth and
environment. And then the heaven and earth would
vibrate with life and joy by virtue of their holy voice
and the power of their songs of adoration. (Let the voice
resound on earth and songs rise to heaven).




2. Yaddha tyad vam purumilhasya sominah pra
vatah.


O Mitra and Varuna, generous heaven and earth
and the skies, listen to the voice of adoration which
people of intelligence and innate virtue bear and offer
as friends to you. Know the yajnic act of the blessed
yajamana of prosperity holding rich libations of soma
for the holy fire. Clear the path of progress for the
worshipper and listen to the songs of the master of a








Generous Mitra and Varuna, sun and cosmic
waters, fire and sun, people living on earth admire your
celebrated rise from heaven through the skies for the
sake of spiritual greatness of honour and smartness of
perfect performance, since on their invocation with holy
action you reach their yajna of love and holiness of non-
violence and bear all round fruits of yajna for the man
of science and speed and for the man of truth and cosmic




4. Pra sa ksitirasura ya mahi priya Rtavanavrtama


O Mitra and Varuna, lords of the universal truth
of being and action, wielders of the pranic energies dear
as life, to the great earth which is so dear to you and to
the people, proclaim the great and universal truth of
life: Bring from the vast heaven of light, both of you,
the mighty strength of being and the conviction of will
and action, yoke the two like the driving force of a
chariot, (like the ruler and the people of the world state),
and join the march of life.


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 151 667






Mitra and Varuna, you come like sun and shower
to the great earth here and bring choice gifts. Pure cows
unsullied by dust, fertile and generous they are, come
home lowing for their calves like the dawns returning
with homage to the sun in the vault of heaven, or like
the birds on the flight back to the nest.




6. A vamrtaya kesiniranusata mitra yatra varuna


Mitra and Varuna, powers of love and justice of
society, where the lights of knowledge and the flames
of yajnic fire in action serve and augment you for the
advancement of truth and rule of law, there your powers
of love and friendship and your power of justice serve,
protect and enrich the earth and the character and
conduct of her children. O light and shower of life, love
and justice, with your heart and soul, create, protect and
strengthen the native intelligence and refine and raise
the knowledge and wisdom of the noble saints and








Mitra and Varuna, teachers, masters and eminent
scholars inspired with love friendship and justice,
whoever does honour and reverence to you and gives
in charity and homage to divinity by yajnas, good
reading, prayer, and noble company, whoever attends
on you with reverence for service, the worshipful man
who has mastered his subject or the poet of vision and
imagination or the generous yajaka, or the man of
knowledge for whom science and honest industry alone
is the key to success, you go to him, I pray, meet him at
his yajna of love, reverence and non-violence, and bless
him with holy words, noble wisdom and discrimination.




8. Yuvam yajnaih prathama gobhiranjata rtavana


Mitra and Varuna, first and foremost lords of
truth and rectitude, whoever approach you with respect
and honour you with yajnas and noble words as the first
choice of their heart and soul, and offer you tributes of


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 152 669


love and reverence with controlled words of honesty
and sincerity, you bless them with the wealth of
knowledge and honour with a mind and spirit free from
the pride of learning.




9. Revadvayo dadhathe revadasathe nara maya-


Mitra and Varuna, eternal lord of love and spirit
of justice and rectitude, you bear and bring the wealth
of health and age of the natural world. Immanent spirits
of divinity in the world, leaders of humanity, with your
innate powers of protection here on earth, you bring us
immense wealth and honour of life. The lights of the
day to-day or tomorrow reach not the immensity of that
grandeur. The rolling seas swell not to the heights of
that immensity. The human voices fail to touch the fringe
of that power and that glory.


Mandala 1/Sukta 152
Mitra-Varuna Devata, Dirghatama Auchathya Rshi






Mitra and Varuna, like day and night, with your




expansion over the world you reveal and cover the forms
of things in existence and your revelations of the things
are faultless. You rule out and overcome illusions and
unrealities since you associate with what is real and true.






This much, may be, one of these wise ones may
know, one who knows the truth, thinks aright, and is
recognised and praised by scholars of distinction as a
man of vision and discrimination. The brilliant scholar
of the four Vedas masters the three dimensions of
knowledge: pure knowledge of Rks, applied knowledge
of Yajus, and the meditative knowledge of sweet
Samans, and, being the prime force and power of
wisdom ever true, never out of date, defeats those who
deny and dishonour the divinities of existence and
eminence of knowledge.






Just as the dawn arises and radiates over the
earth before moving humanity rises and goes out on
business, so does the Original Knowledge of Revelation


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 152 671


radiate whole before it is analysed into distinctive
branches. Which of your scholars, O Mitra and Varuna,
powers of vision and wisdom, knows that? Probably
the man-treasure of knowledge bears the burden of it,
maintains it and feeds it with detailed application and
overcomes illusion and confusion.




4. Prayantamit pari jaram kaninam pasyamasi


Just as we see the sun, lover of the maidenly
dawns, gather up the lights and moving on, never
resting, so do we see the scholar, treasure-home of
knowledge, lover of rising generations, moving on in
his pursuit of knowledge, never resting and rusting, but
expanding far and wide the light of knowledge, wherein
lies the favourite love of Lord Supreme, lord of light as
well as of the bottomless deep of annihilation.






The sun is arisen, up on the heights of heaven,
generations pay homage, singing hymns of Infinity,
admiring the treasure love of the Lord for the sake of
Mitra and Varuna, love, light and justice of existence.






6. A dhenavo mamateyamavantirbrahmapriyam


Just as cows feed their calves on milk from their
darling child of love and promote him in his favourite
studies of Divinity, so should the scholar of the ways
and laws of the world ask for food and maintenance
and, serving and shining, advance the study and
knowledge of nature and eternity.






O Mitra and Varuna, brilliant and generous lords
of love and justice, I pray, I may, with your protection,
choose to worship you with the homage of love,
dedication and sacrifice. Bless our songs of adoration
among our people with wealth and honour of success
and may our projects of action be holy and powerful,
taking us across the high seas of life. Let our showers
be showers of divinity and redemption.


Mandala 1/Sukta 153
Mitra-Varuna Devata, Dirghatama Auchathya Rshi


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 153 673




Mitra and Varuna, great, loving, rejoicing,
friends of humanity, lords of love and justice,
resplendent with flames of ghrta, we love, honour and
worship you with salutations, service and oblations of
high grades of ghrta, and the devotees, dedicated and
worshipful, bring holy offerings with sincere prayers
like high-priests of yajna for you and for us.




2. Prastutirvam dhama na prayuktirayami mitra-


Mitra, lord of love, and Varuna, lord of justice, I
come to you as to my home and haven of peace, comfort
and grace, having abandoned the storms of disturbance
and temptation. My concentration is complete and my
song of praise is divine. Lords of generosity, brave is
the yajaka, come to join you in congregations of prayer
and action, doing honour and homage to you, waiting
for grace and comfort of well-being.







Mitra and Varuna, whoever the yajaka giving
oblations in the yajna of love and charity to you like a
noble human being, who invokes you and prays for help
in his tasks of life, thanking you and serving you in
infinite blessings to that man of truth and sacrifice.




4. Uta vam viksu madyasvandho gava apasca


Mitra and Varuna, friends, teachers and leaders
of humanity, may the cows and the holy voices,
consecrated holy waters and food and the juice of soma
among the happy people surfeit you with delight. And
may the ancient master of our yajna of education,
governance and production giving us the fruits of
holiness sustain the yajna, and may you too continue to
enjoy the fruits of that yajna and drink the milk of the
cow as well as the lights of dawn.


Mandala 1/Sukta 154
Vishnu Devata, Dirghatama Auchathya Rshi


Let me well recite the grand acts of Vishnu, lord


MANDAL - 1 /SUKTA - 154 675


immanent, all pervasive, of the universe, who creates
all worlds of the universe, who sustains the high regions
of light in upper space and, having created, maintains it
three ways, 1.e., as a system, as part of the cosmic system,
and in relation to the other systems, the lord who is
sung and celebrated everywhere.






That Vishnu who is sung and celebrated by
virtue of his might, is the lord who pervades the universe
everywhere just as the awful lion, lord of the mountain
cave, majestically moves around over the tortuous paths
of the forest. In the vast three-fold acts of his mighty
creation, i.e., the acts of projection, sustenance and
withdrawal, reside the entire worlds of existence.






May this powerful song of celebration reach
Vishnu, celebrated lord, great and generous, who holds
in balance the heights of the universe of space and time
and creates it just in three steps of sattva, rajas and tamas,
1.e., mind, motion and matter, or the three regions of
earth, sky and the heaven of light.






4. Yasya tri purnad madhuna padanyakstyamana


The threefold worlds of his, earth, heaven and
the middle regions, full and perfect in their own ways
and character, honey sweet and undecaying, rejoice in
the lord’s presence with their inmates by their innate
power of sustenance. He, the sole lord, by himself, holds
the entire worlds of existence including heaven and earth
created of the three modes of Prakrti, sattva, rajas and
tamas.






May I rise to and follow that cherished path of
lord Vishnu and reach that state of being wherein the
noble people dedicated to Divinity live and rejoice in
bliss. This lord of divine power and action is friend of
the industrious men of relentless action, and there in
his supreme presence flows the stream of divine love
and bliss.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 155 677


6. Ta vam vastunyusmasi gamadhyai yatra gavo


Men of dedication, yogis, teachers and
preachers, scholars and scientists, wedded couples, for
your rest and abiding residence where you should go
and rest, we want those places where the sharp and
penetrative rays of the divine sun should reach for
enlightenment. Here only is the place, and we want your
abode here, where the supreme abode of the generous
and the omnipotent Vishnu shines with abundant light
and bliss.


Mandala 1/Sukta 155
Vishnu Devata, Dirghatama Auchathya Rshi




1. Pra vah pantamandhaso dhiyayate mahe suraya


Of your delicious food and soma drink, offer in
homage to the great and mighty Vishnu, lord of
intelligence, and to Indra, bold and mighty lord of energy
and power. Both stand on top of mountains and clouds
and on top of heaven, firm and inviolable high, as the
mountaineer stands firm on top of a mountain peak by
the best and strongest equipment.


(According to Swami Dayanand, the mantra may
be applied to the teachers and scholars of a nation who
reach on top of learning and knowledge by arduous




efforts of mountainous degree and do their work freely
and courageously.)






Indra, lord of power such as lightning, and
Vishnu, lord of light such as the sun, extend and expand
the range and potential of the mighty shooting archer’s
missile-fitted defence of humanity. And thus does the
man of yajna, protecting, promoting and drinking the
soma-joy of the nation, extend and expand the blaze of
the battle of the mighty defender of the nation and thus
does he glorify you both, Indra and Vishnu.






Those oblations of yajna food and distilled soma
augment the great creative power of this Vishnu, spirit
of the universe, for procreative virility and divine
enjoyment of the world of existence. He vests it in the
mother powers of nature, 1.e., heaven and earth. Then
the off-spring bears the name of the father, the one that
is the ultimate, as the child of Divinity, and the other
that is the worldly name of his family. The third the


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 155 679


Lord bears over and above the light of heaven.




4. Tattadidasya paumsyam grnimasinasya tratura-


That procreative virility of this lord Vishnu at
every step of it, we celebrate in songs of joy, that
creativity of the lord saviour and protector, generous
and not rapacious who takes away nothing for himself,
creator supreme and lord of cosmic fertility, who
completes the creation of the natural universe in three
steps of sattva, rajas and tamas — thought, energy and
matter — for the delightful life of the soul, and then
transcends the work of his own creation.






To know the grandeur of the lord seer of light
and bliss across two steps of his creation, earth and the
heavens of light, the human soul stirs in mind and
intelligence. The third step no one can, or ought to,
violate, overcome or ignore, not even people of the
highest imagination, like birds of the strongest wings,
can do so.






6. Caturbhih sakam navatim ca namabhiscakram na


Inspiring, moving, measuring four and ninety
names of the passage of chronological time, circulating
in the cosmic circle of eternal time, rotating, revolving,
eternally recurring, the mighty cosmic bodied Vishnu,
ever young, never a teenager, moves the universe,
himself unmoved and unmoving, and transcendent, and
he listens and attends to our invocations of yajna with
the Rkvi hymns of praise and celebration.


Mandala 1/Sukta 156

worshipped by the wise and eminent scholars, served
by the generous devotees of yajna, let the song of

One who lovingly and generously does homage
to Vishnu, ancient and yet most modern lord of

knowledge for the devotees of knowledge, one who
speaks and communicates this great new message of
the great lord of universal knowledge, and one who
practices this applicable and useful knowledge with
thanks and grateful offerings in yajna for charity and
social service, he is the real man.






Admirers and worshippers of the ancient and
eternal lord of knowledge, Vishnu, as much as you know
the lord and his knowledge, please augment and advance
that body of knowledge with your own growth and




And knowing the lord and his knowledge, speak of the
knowledge to the seekers in full confidence. O Vishnu,

of your knowledge and wisdom.




4. Tamasya raja varunastamasvina kratum sacanta


Brilliant Varuna, lord of light and favourite
choice of all, and the Ashvins, harbingers of the dawn
of new knowledge, in unison, join that noble and yajnic
act of the knowledge and revelation of Vishnu, lord of
universal knowledge and instant controller of the
Maruts, tempestuous heroes of action, for furtherance
and application. Vishnu, commanding the force of his
friends, wields the highest knowledge and expertise of
action and opens the paths of action brilliant as day for
humanity to follow and advance.




Vishnu, generous and divine lord of knowledge,
friend of all, brilliant hero of action, better and ever

of knowledge, action and worship, goes forward to join

great and golden dawn wrapt in beauty waxes on the
horizon with the splendour of her glory. The Ashvins,

inspiration for action.








Ashvins, harbingers of new light and life, chariot

our struggle for the joy of life, inspire and strengthen
our Brahma system of research and education with new

Here, may the three engined, three staged, honey
carrier, superfast chariot of the Ashvins come, the chariot

appreciation and return for this love and generosity of

never burn me off, which otherwise bound up in the
soul as the fire of grief and despair eats up the very
flesh of the body.






Let the streams be most motherly and kind
saviours to me, simple, natural and unhurtful person as

torso and his own shoulders.

The person lost in darkness of the deep, having

of one put in. Let the nobles speak to you of this. Create
four clouds out of one, the scholars would speak to you.




And to that end I too would come to you. Men of the
mighty bow, if you would but do this, then with the
light of divinities and with the nobilities, you would be
the real men of yajna.






Agni, scholar, scientist, technologist, if you were
to say about agni, the harbinger of fire and electric
power: the horse power has to be developed, the chariot
has to be designed and developed here and now, and
the language has to be found and developed, and youth
has to be developed and rejuvenated, and the horse and
the cow have to be groomed and developed, then dear
brother, we would follow you in action for both fire
and electric power.




4. Cakrvamsa rbhavastadaprcchata kvedabhid yah


O Rbhus, eminent scientists, technologists and
engineers of the top-most intellectual order of vision
and dynamic action, if that messenger of knowledge,
light and fire energy were to come to us, ask him where




the origin of that power is, and who the messenger is,
since when Tvashta, analyst and maker of fine things,
analysed one form of composite matter or compound
such as the cloud or a ladleful of sacrificial input of the
earth, water, heat and vayu, wind energy of electric
potential, then only was agni energy able to move things
over and into the moving spheres such as earth.




5. Hanamainan iti tvasta yadabraviccamasam ye


If Tvashta, master analyst and expert maker,
were to say: “Let us reject these,’ about those who mock
at the ladleful of yajnic input or the cloud, analysed,
synthesised and restructured, then let us reject the undue
criticism. And when the soma has been distilled, that is,
when the result has been obtained from the scientific
yajna, let us describe the achievement by other names,
and let the delighted beneficiary too call the new product
by other favourite names, the soma is worthy of the gods
to drink.



6. Indro hari yuyuje asvina ratham brhaspatirvisva-


MANDAL - 1 /SUKTA - 161 697


Let Indra, master of energy, power and sunlight,
use the knowledge of fire, electricity, radiation and
gravitation. Let the Ashvins, masters of the chariot,
prepare the car. Let Brhaspati, expert of the earth’s
variety of objects and scientific language, create the
formulae of analysis and structure. Let Rbhu, expert of
the science of universal energy, with Vibhu, brilliant
man of light and fire, and Vaja, expert of speed and
control, all noble powers of great action, reach the divine
sources of nature’s wealth and energy and enjoy their
share of the gifts of corporate programmes of yajnic
creation.






With dexterous use of your ideas, repair and
enrich the surface of the earth like nourishing the holy
cow emaciated to the skin, and rejuvenate those who
are breaking down under the weight of aging and
consumptive diseases. O warriors of the bow, create new
vehicles of wondrous velocity from materials of
magnetic energy and radiation. And then yoke your
motive power to the chariot and reach the wealth of






8. Idamudakam pibatetyabravitanedam va gha


Master experts of pharmacy and distillation of
medicinal drinks, to the patients and admirers say: Taste
and drink this tonic, or drink this one which has been
purified and reinforced with munja grass, and if you
choose to drink neither, then take this one prepared in
the third distillation for purity and power and be happy.


MANU

9. Apo bhiuyistha ityeko abravidagnirbhiyistha


One of the experts says: waters are the best and
most efficacious. Another says: fire is the best and most
efficacious. Out of all, one speaks of earth as the most
powerful for life and against anti-life. Thus do you all
speak of the existent elements of truth and reality and
distinguish between one source of power and grandeur
and another for yourself and develop the same.




10. Srondmeka udakam gamavajati mamsamekah


One takes water to the disabled cow, the other


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 161 699


dresses the wound suffered from accidental hurt, yet
another looks after the shed and removes the dirt the
whole day till sunset. What would the parents expect of
children to approve, more than this?




11. Udvatsvasma akrnotana trnam nivatsvapah


All ye men and women, with all your desire and
good action on higher ground, grow fodder for cows
and other animals, and produce and store water in lower
places. Do not destroy anything in the open home of
even a carefree person and always follow wise and
intelligent persons of noble and expert performance.




12. Sammilya yad bhuvana paryasarpata kva svit


Rbhus, experts of tempestuous action, join
together with concentrated action, go round the worlds
and know them, and take care where your progenitors
then abide. Accost and face whoever holds up your hand,
and thank and appreciate whoever approves your action
with praise.






13. Susupvamsa rbhavastadaprcchatagohya ka idam


Sleeping Rbhus, like potential scholars and rays
of the sun, ask that supreme lord of light such as sun
who it is who wakes them up into light and life. He, the
lord of light from whom nothing is hidden says: it is
vayu, waves of divine energy, which wakes them up
into life and light. The lord of light is the shelter home
of all. It is now a year (cycle) when you awaken us and
tell us of that to-day.


(It is life waking up to self-consciousness at the
dawn of creation after a ‘long year’ of sleep in Divinity
during the long night of annihilation.)




14. Diva yanti maruto bhumya’ gnirayam 1610


Maruts, waves of universal energy of the winds,
go with the light of the sun. The fire energy goes with
the earth. Vata, the currents of wind go with the middle
region of the sky. Varuna, water energy, goes with the
vapours and the seas. You, indefatigable seekers of
knowledge, go with the Rbhus, imperishable children

of might and omnipotence.

(Ashva, the horse, here is a metaphor of the Nation)




1. Ma no mitro varuno aryamayurindra rbhuksa


May Mitra, the friend, Varuna, lord supreme
worthy of universal choice and homage, Aryama, lord
of justice, Ayu, man of knowledge, Indra, lord of power
and honour, Rbhuksha, man of intelligence and wisdom,
and Maruts, dynamic men of creative action, never
ignore us since we too admire and celebrate powerful
acts of the mighty pioneer leader of war born of noble
qualities, 1.e., acts performed in our yajnic battle of life.




2. Yannirnija reknasa pravrtasya ratim grbhitam


We are those who advance to the front the man
of honour and generosity, leader blest with wealth and
power earned by pure and sinless means, possessing
universal virtues, capable of versatile roles, going




forward leading and roaring, who achieves the cherished
gifts of the dignity and prosperity of Indra and Pushan,
lord of power and glory and the lord of light and plenty.






This undaunted horse blest with all noble
quality, gift of nature’s generosity, is taken along with
the fast war horse by the driver in advance for the
training of the warrior’s favourite so that the expert
cavalry trainer may prepare the loved grooming for the
steed for his victory.




4. Yaddhavisyamrtuso devayanam trirmanusah


When men take this horse out and around for
grooming thrice according to the seasons, then this
horse, prime gift of nature’s generosity, fit for the noblest
heroes to ride to the yajna of the battle of rectitude,
of advance in the battle for the noble warriors to hear,
here in the world.




MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 162 703




The man of yajna, the high-priest of love and
non-violence, the faithful giver of oblations, the lighter
of the holy fire, the grinder of soma, the singer of the
hymns, and the noble scholar Brahmana, all ye yajakas
in unison, light up the fire, and with that yajna gracefully
completed with love, faith and expertise, fill the streams
of life and the land with waters and prosperity.




6. Yupavraska uta ye yupavahascasalam ye asvayu-


Those who cut the tree for the yajna flag post,
those who transport the post to the yajnic arena, he who
shapes the flag bearing part of the post, those who bear
and bring in the holy food for the consecrated horse,
symbol of the nation and its order of governance, and
among all these the master of ceremonies and the
coordination and cooperation of all these may, we wish
and pray, oblige us with success.







Let the horse, symbol of the nation of humanity
and the order of governance, come forward for us. Let
it uphold the thoughts and values of the nation. Strong
of back and body, let it fulfil the hopes and dreams of
me and all the nobilities of humanity. In consequence,
the scholars and the visionaries would enjoy themselves
and celebrate its grandeur. Let us do our best in service
for this noble order of brotherhood for the development
and advancement of the noble people.




8. Yad vajino dama samdanamarvato ya Ssirsanya


The law that controls the onward movement of
this dynamic social order, symbolised by the foot-band
of the mighty and tempestuous horse, is the law of self-
restraint and Dharma. The reins and bridle which control
it over the head and shoulders symbolise thought,
wisdom and self-guidance. And the grass which is held
in the mouth symbolises the nourishment and health of
the nation. May all these be of holy nature and character
fit for the divinities among humanity, and let all these
be dedicated to the divinities that support life.



9. Yadasvasya kraviso maksikasa yad va svarau




MANDAL - 1 /SUKTA - 162 705


Whatever the fly eats of the sweat or ointment
of the horse of rhythmic motion, 1.e., the nation on the
march, or whatever smears the voice or sword of the
nation, and whatever soils the hands and nails of the
performers of national yajna, all these things should be
under control of the brilliant and generous leaders of
the nation for you, 1.e., the people and the nation.




10. Yaduvadhyam-udarasyapavati ya amasya kraviso


Whatever the gaseous exudations or wastes from
consumption in the national economy, whatever
discharges from the bio-economic circulation of raw
materials towards the output of finished products, all
these wastes and by-products should be positively
recycled by the expert managers of the economy who
must also season whatever is ripe and ready for further
refinement and sophistication.



11. Yat te gatrad-agnina pacyamanad-abhi sulam


O nation on the march on the highway of
progress, if from your personality-body subjected to the
fire of discipline and self sacrifice, a cry of pain escape




your lips or a tear flow down from the eye, let it not soil
the holy ground of the motherland, nor let it be lost in
the straw, but let it be a precious gift for the ambitious
creators and leaders of vision to turn it into a clarion
call or a beautiful pearl of divine grace.




12. Ye vajinam paripasyanti pakvam ya imahuh


Those who watch the nation’s food and
prosperity grow to ripeness and perfection, and those
who say: Ah yes! it is fragrant, harvest it, take it, export
it too! and those who contribute their share to the
nation’s prosperity and also wait for their share of the
food and fragrance of yajna, and in addition, their
coordination, cooperation and common voice of
exhortation may, we pray, be for the good and growth
of us all.



13. Yanniksanam mamspacanya ukhaya ya patrani

Watchful stirring of the nation’s cauldron of


prosperity on fire and careful preservation and
enrichment of the earth’s fertility which gives fruits and


MANDAL - 1 /SUKTA - 162 707


other foods, all containers and reservoirs of juice and
waters for irrigation, methods of heat and steam control,
formations of clouds, known, controlled and created,
and beauty spots and tourist resorts, these are marks of
a nation’s march on top of beauty and culture.




14. Nikramanam nisadanam vivartanam yacca


The horse’s forward march, the nation launching
on action on the highway, its halting and settling for
rest on the way, the U-turn and circulation in
progression, the fetter control of law and the centre-
hold of values for stability, what it drinks for pleasure
and excitement and what it eats for nourishment: all
these should be under control of the men of vision and
brilliance for you all.




15. Ma tvagnirdhvanayid dhumagandhirmokha


Let not the fire interfused with smoke and smell
enthusiasm for life. Nor let the aromatic pan on blazing
fire tip over and spill out the food. (Let the nation be




ripened in the cauldron of hard discipline and yajnic
action placed on the right degree of heat free of smoke
and blaze both). The dynamic nation which is loved,
happy and peaceful, active, and sanctified by yajna, is,
like a trained horse, loved, accepted and owned by the
most brilliant powers of the world.




16. Yadasvaya vasa upastrnantyadhivasam ya


Those who provide the decorative cover for the
horse, i.e., the yajnic personality of the human nation
on the march, and provide the over-cover as the air cover
of fire for defence and onward march, and those who
create the golden beauties for it, and the control of law,
and the velocity of electric energy, and the brakes of
equal power: all these people, cherished powers and
beauties of the nation, raise the humans to the light of

On your being exhausted by excessive urging
on, or by hurt with the spur or the whip, I relieve you of
the hurt and exhaustion and refresh you in the yajnas of


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 162 709


love and non-violence by the fragrance of oblations
offered with the ladle and chant of hymns. (The nation,
after strain in a crisis, needs rest and repair.)




18. Catustrimsad vajino devabandhor-vankrir-


The innate energy of fire, electric, magnetic and
of other forms, fastest form of energy co-existent with
the forms and powers of nature such as earth, moves in
waves in thirtyfour ways. Activate it part by part,
proclaim the nature and character of each and realise
the definite quality of its efficacy and application to
parts of the material body with safety.








Of the dynamic energy of agni, two are the
carrier currents, of which one is the active, positive agent
that activates the connected objects. And I apply the
power to the material forms of objects according to the
needs of the seasons, and having done so I send it back
into agni, thereby completing the yajnic circuit.






20. Ma tva tapat priya atmapiyantam ma svadhiti-


Spirit and genius of the nation, while you are
on your path of progress to divinity, may your soul never
cause any sense of self-guilt, nor must your own power
and pride nor external force strain or terrorize your mind
and body. Nor must any greedy or malicious power or
person, unmindful of the hurt and cruelty, wound or

Spirit of humanity, genius of the nation, soul of
the individual, this you are, and such as you are, you
shall not die, nor be hurt, nor hurt anyone, since you
move in the direction of divinity by paths which are
straight and sure. Two are the horses yoked to your
resounding chariot: love of the Lord that attracts you,
and Grace that holds you in stability. And the horse that
is yoked to the centre-pole is faster than light and instant
as the mind.

22. Sugavyam no vaji svasvyam pumsah putran uta


May this lightning power of agni, this nation,
this great order of governance give us rich wealth of
cows, fertility of land and generosity of spirit. May it
give us strong and powerful horses, speed of
transportation and the spirit to go ahead, manliness and
brave warriors, noble children and honest wealth for
universal nourishment. May the imperishable Mother
Nature inspire us to create holiness free from sinfulness
of thought, word and deed, and may omnipotent Agni,
lord of universal wealth, help us build a mighty social
order of governance.


Mandala 1/Sukta 163
Ashva (Agni) Devata, Dirghatama Auchathya Rshi








born of Lord Omnipotent, rising from the oceans of
space, the sky and the sea, who roared with force at
your very birth, your wings are like the wings of the




celestial eagle that brings the showers of soma and the
warmth of fire, and your arms are like the arms of the
sun, the thunderbolt. Surely great is your birth from
nature, worthy of admiration and homage.






This energy is the gift of the universal controller
Yama, a product of Vayu, the first elemental form of
energy born of akasha, ether, in the process of primal
evolution guided by the eternal law-giver, the creator.
Let Trita, master of the three modes of nature, sattva,
rajas and tamas, i.e., thought, energy and matter, plan
the use of it in various ways. Let Indra, the electrical
of earth sciences, hold the control of it in gravitational,
magnetic and heat forms. And let the Vasus, graduate
researchers of life sciences, extract this energy from the
light of the sun.






Cosmic energy, Yama you are the mover, the
condition and control of all dynamics. You are the light
and the sun. You are the energy in use. You are Trita,


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 163 713


vitality, strength and power by virtue of your unseen
and mysterious character. You are integrated with the
life and joy of existence and yet you are distinct and
exclusive. It is said that you are bonded with the regions
of light in three ways.




4. Trini ta Ghurdivi bandhanani trinyapsu trinyantah


Three are your forms, they say, in the field of
light, they are causal, subtle and gross. Three are in the
sphere of the waters, and three are in the region of the
skies in the winds, the same three. Just as you have three
formal definitions so do I too, the causal body, the subtle
body and the gross body. Tell me, mysterious power,
where do they say your ultimate origin is. Mine too is






O Vajin, tempestuous power-input of the yajna
of existence, these are the stages of your refinement,
contentive concentrations of the applicable values of
energy which are positive gifts of wealth and well-being
for humanity. I wish and pray I may see those positive
lines of natural and scientific developments of yours




which observe, preserve and advance the process of




6. Atmanam te manasaradajanamavo diva pata-


Agni, O flying horse, with pleasure of my heart
and soul and with the thrill of my knowledge, I see from
afar and know your body flying up towards heaven and
down like a bird. O flying bird of our creation, I see
your head striving and soaring higher and higher by
paths all straight and clear and wholly free from dust.






Agni, O vital fire and creativity of life, I have
seen that higher form, spirit and character of yours which
is eager to conquer, consume and create the food and
energy on the floor of the earth since, when the mortal
humanity blest with food and enjoyment, and as a result
of your holy ambition, eats their fill, then, O consumer
and creator, you beget the herbs and juices for
rectification of the human faults and weaknesses.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 163 715


8. Anu tva ratho anu maryo arvannanu gdavo’nu


Agni, Arvan, energy and power of lightning
motion, the chariot, the car and the flying birds of human
creation depend on you and follow your laws. The
mortal humanity admires and follows you. The cows
and the maidens and their matrimony and joy depend
on you. The wealth and honour of admirers depends on
you. Devotees of sacred vows and yoga practices court
your love and friendship. And divine personalities of
nature and humanity both are keen to realise your energy,
virility and creativity.

9. Hiranyasrngo’yo asya pada manojava avara


Golden headed and lustrous is this agni, energy
and power of nature, with the wheels of metals of desired
gravity for motion and speed. The noblest divinities love
to win and enjoy the cherished gifts of this agni. Indra,
constant, ancient and yet the latest lord of the speed of
mind is the exceptional master who first of all rides and
controls this dynamic energy of nature’s motive power.






10.  Irmantasah silikamadhyamasah sam suranaso


Arvan, universal energy in motion, sleek and
sophisticated, vibrating with power, steadily
accelerating, celestial birds of flight, like rows of cranes
in formation, join, march and fly and rise over the
heavenly paths of skies and space. Agni, lord of light
and knowledge, Indra, lord of energy and power, such
are the horses of your creation, these are your birds of
power.




11. Tava Sariram patayisnvarvan tava cittam vata iva


O Arvan, tempestuous energy of the universe,
your body is ever eager and agitating to fly. Your mind
is restless, adventurous and vibrating as the waves of
winds. Your ambitions are high soaring, various,
pioneering and ever on the move. Inspiring the minds
of men, bright and blazing in the forests overtaken, your
thoughts, ambitions and operations spread around and
cover the worlds across the spaces.



12. Upa pragacchasanam vajyarva devadrica




Agni, warlike courser, impetuous on the wing
goes forward. It goes by all, in advance of all, moving
the worlds on the march, inspiring, enlightening,
elevating the divinities, thinking, meditating, shining
by the light of its own intelligence. Unborn eternal is
the source and centre of its power by which it is ignited,
geared and steered on the way, and when it moves, poets
follow singing and celebrating the beauty of existence,
the glory of Divinity in action.






The same horse, Agni, mighty carrier of the
universe, reaches the highest heaven and home of
existence, and there joins the ultimate original and eternal
mother, Prakrti, and father creator, the Lord Almighty.
O mighty harbinger of life and joy, loved and blest and
most admired, go and reach the divinities to-day upon
this instant and bring the cherished gifts of life for the
admirer and the generous giver performer of yajna.

Soma, Keshins, Vak and Surya, Samvatsara, Sarasvati,
Dirghatama Auchathya Rshi







1. Asya vamasya palitasya hotustasya bhrata


Of this splendid and hoary yajaka, Sun, giver
of light and energy and receiver of the waters and
essences of the earth and the skies, the second, younger
and middling brother is vayu, wind and electricity
abiding in the middle region of the skies, the energy
being voracious and present everywhere. The third and
youngest brother is Agni, fire, which is sprinkled with
water and ghrta in yajna. It is the sustainer of living
beings and it is blest with seven children, i.e., seven
rays of light in the spectrum. I wish I could know this
ancient, brilliant and sustaining power and friend of life.




2. Sapta yunjanti ratham-ekacakram-eko asvo


Seven enjoin the one-wheel chariot, drawn by
one horse of seven names. The wheel, the wheel of time,
unaging and automotive, has three sub-wheels with three
naves and rims, and in the orbit of this time and space
abide all the worlds of the universe.








Seven are those who ride this chariot, seven
motive powers (horses or rays of light) which draw this
chariot of seven wheels, wheel within wheel. They are
seven sisters who exult, roar and thunder together in
reverence and worship of the father where in are hidden
in depth seven names of the rays of light, the seven
spheres and seven notes of language. (This is a highly
mystical, symbolic, and at the same time scientific
mantra. To understand the meaning and implication at
different levels of correspondence we need knowledge
of astronomy, cosmology, physics and astrophysics,
language and grammar, music and mechanics. And still
the meaning would remain open ended.)




4. Ko dadarsa prathamam jayamanm-asthana-
état.


Who saw the first material form of the universe
of flesh and bone being born, which the immaterial of
no flesh and bone bears? What and where was the breath
and blood and soul of the earth and cosmos? Who would
reach the visionary of knowledge to ask all this of the
first and last question about the mystery?








Novice, ignorant but searching for knowledge
and passing through the crucibles of heat and light of
discipline, I ask with sincere mind and soul about these
seven divine stages of the evolution of nature and life
concealed in mystery, the seven-fold warp and woof of
which visionary poets have traced and described in detail
for the children of light to see and know and realise.




6. Acikitvan cikitusascidatra kavin prcchami vid-


Not knowing what I would know here as a man
of knowledge should know, I ask of the men of
knowledge and poets of divine vision what that single
principle of power could be in the form and nature of
the one unborn and eternal Supreme which holds these
six higher and lower spheres and atmospheres of the




7. tha bravitu ya manga vedasya vamasya nihitam


Dear friend, here may speak to me he who well




knows the power and presence of this glorious bird ever
on the wing and omnipresent, which is concealed in
mystery. The holy rays of it from above yield showers
of milk and water for life, and, covered in brilliant beauty
they drink up the waters as they come and touch the
earth with their feet.




of Mata pitaramrta a babhaja dhityagre manasa sam


The proud and amorous mother seeks the
company of father for the waters of life and joins him
with love and her innate power of motherhood. Then
she receives the rain showers of life and the children of
nature receive the food for the body and Word for the
mind with reverence and worship.






The mother, earth, is joined to the sun and held
in orbit in circumambulation of the sun on its own axis.
The productive power and the seed of life stays in the
clouds within its atmosphere along with it in its motion
in the three orbits, i.e., on its own axis, round the sun
and in the galaxy, and when it matures it roars and




showers, looking at mother earth of various colour and
form like a calf looking at the mother cow.




10. Tisro matrstrin pitrn bibhradeka urdhvastasthau


The one Supreme lord of the universe who
abides over all sustains the three mothers, earth, sky
and the heavens of light, and He sustains the three
fathers, Agni, Vayu and Aditya, fire, wind and sun. These
three couples tire Him not, they smear Him not. On the
heights of the heaven of that lord Prajapati, they meditate
on this voice of omniscience and recreate and replenish
the life sustaining energy and the creative vitality and
fertility of motherhood.






The twelve-spoked wheel of time in existence
that goes round and round the cosmic sun never ages.
O Agni, light of humanity, the seven hundred and
twenty-children of nature, i1.e., the three hundred and
sixty day-night pairs or seven hundred and twenty forms
of material composition remain till the end of


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 164 723




12. Pancapadam pitaram dvadasakrtim diva ahuh


Father time, they say, has five stages from the
initial moment onward and twelve divisions in the round
of the year of time extending over existence in the farther
half of the universe beyond the region of light. These
others speak of this other half visible this side above,
below the sun, which has six spokes of the seasons in
the yearly round and moves in seven rounds of wheels,
wheel within wheel of time.

(This concept of time space requires deep
research into the nature and passage of time including
the technique of measurement and calculation with
reference to the visible world and the world beyond on
the other side of the sun. Parardha, the other half, for
example, is equal to 50 years of Brahma, his one day
being equal to the age of the current world of existence.
It is a mind boggling concept in ordinary terms of
calculation.)



13. Pancare cakre parivartamane tasminna tasthur-






Five are the spokes in the wheel of time-cum-
prakrti, the temporal existence of physical world.


(These are the five elements of prakrti, akasha,
vayu, agni, apah and prthivi, and their internal changes).
This wheel of prakrti in time is ever on the move. In
that wheel of time and physical change abide all the
worlds of the universe. The axis of that carries the
immense weight of existence but it never gets heated.
With its centre-hold on this axis it has been going on
since eternity and it will go on till eternity, but it never
wears away. It is never destroyed. (The axis of the
physio-temporal wheel is the constant substratum,
original Prakrti, and the centre-hold is the Lord




14. Sanemi cakramajaram vi vavrta uttanayam dasa


Existent with its centre and circumference, the
unaging wheel, the chariot, of the universe of physio-
temporal nature goes on and on, round and round. In
the expansive Prakrti, ten motive powers move it on
(those ten being the pranic energies). The light of the
sun suffused with rajas, energy of universal dynamics,
goes on with the worlds. Indeed, all the worlds of
existence abide in that light and energy.




MANDAL - 1/SUKTA - 164 725


15. Sakanjanam saptathamahurekajam salid yama


The seven simultaneously born of one-unborn,
they call a septet, that is, seven-in-one or one-in-seven.
Six of them are yamas, twin movers. They are rshis,
mixers, born of devas, light and energy. Their properties
and actions according to their place and character are
created and ordained, and they, each in its form and
character, move around for and in the unmoved mover.


(These seven are the seven lokas: Bhuh, Bhuvah,
Svah, Mahah, Janah, Tapah and Satyam. Sometimes the
lokas are associated with seven Rshis. Sometimes they
are described as seven senses and sometimes seven vital
energies. All these refer, in fact point, to a theory of
correspondences existing at the physical, mental and
spiritual levels, or at the levels of matter, energy, thought
and spirit. And this is a subject of high research and
deep meditation.)




16. Striyah satistan u me pumsa ahuh pasyada-


Female they are, intelligent and educated, and
though women, I am told rightly, they are male too. One
who has eyes can see this, but one who is blind, even
though he has eyes, doesn’t see this, doesn’t know. The
son who has the vision of a poet knows this well, and




one who knows this has an old head on young shoulders.
In other words, he has the vision and knowledge of the
father of fathers.




17. Avah parena para enavarena pada vatsam


Bearing and sustaining her child, as a cow bears
and sustains her calf, this earth by her own motion goes
down with reference to that farther side and goes up
with reference to this nearer side in relation to the sun,
and stays up stabilized in space in its own orbit. In what
direction and to which remote region of space does she
go? What does she impel and energise and how? Does
she receive consecration of the sun in the midst of a




18. Avah parena pitaram yo asyanuveda para


Here who could be the man of poetic vision who
knows this lower side of the earth with reference to that
other higher side, and that higher side with reference to
this lower side, and who further knows the father sun,
lord sustainer of the earth, and who knows and who can
say where from this brilliant and divine mind is born?

19. Ye arvancastan u paraca ahur-ye-parancastan u


Whatever objects are near, they say, are far off,
and the objects far off, they say, are close at hand. (All
objects are on the move and whether they are far or
near is a matter of relativity. It is nothing absolute.) O
Soma, Vayu energy, whatever you and the lord
of objects, ever such as stars and galaxies, carry on the
worlds of the universe as horses joined to the yoke and
the pole draw the chariot of existence.




20. Dva suparna sayuja sakhaya samanam vrksam


Two birds of beautiful wings, the individual
human soul and the Supreme Soul of the universe, both
friends and companions, together nest on the same one
tree of existence. Of the two, one, the individual human
soul, eats the fruit with relish and enjoys as well as
suffers the consequences. The other, the Supreme Soul,






21. Yatra suparna amrtasya bhagam-animesam


Where the blessed souls of noble action sing
and celebrate their share of immortal joy in holy voice
incessantly, therein, may, I pray, the constant
imperishable sovereign Ruler, protector and sustainer
of the entire universe, inspire and bless me, the honest
soul in preparation for the consecration.




22. Yasmin vrkse madhvadah suparna nivisante


To that tree over and above the mortal world
whereon the super-souls of beautiful wings of blessed
action nestle in a state of consecration and taste the
nectar honey of divine joy, whose taste of the fruit the
ancients describe as super-sweet, to that tree of immortal
taste and bliss they do not attain who do not know the






23. Yad gayatre adhi gayatramahitam traistubhad va
nasuh.


They attain to that immortal state of bliss who
know and experience the Spirit which is the lord
protector of the celebrants of Divinity immanent in the
gayatri verses in their recitations, who rejoice in the
divine presence above the trishbubh verses and actualise
that presence in life without break, who rise to the height
of Divinity and share the dynamic presence vibrating
in the universe and revealed in jagati verses, and
commune with that presence.


(In scientific terms, the earth is gayatri. The fire
of yajna is lit on the earth. Traishtubh is the sky. The
wind is vibrant and operative there. Dyu is jagati, most
dynamic. There aditya, the sun, reigns. Agni, fire is the
vitality of the earth, wind is the energy of the sky, and
the sun is the life of the heavens. Those who know these
regions, their life and vitality and realise their vitality
and the spirit of Divinity which informs them and their
vitality attain to the state of immortal bliss.)



24.  Gayatrena prati mimite arkamarkena sama




In gayatri metre the Rks are composed. With
Rks, the Samans are composed. With trishtubh metre




Vak, Yajus are composed. By Vak, Yajurveda, and further
Vak, Atharva Veda, is composed and formed. And with
two-pada and four-pada constituents of the eternal Word,
all the seven forms of Vedic compositions in metric
forms of verse, are composed.


(In scientific terms, gayatri is Parameshthi
Prana, universal energy at the highest level, from
universal energy, specific forms of energy are created.
One of these specific forms is Rk, rhythmic energy
operative in thought consciousness. When pranic energy
the reed or the larynx, sound is produced. When rhythm
is added to sound, music is produced. When elements
of sound are related to particular points of the speech
mechanism, then phonemes, elements of sound in
language forms, are produced. And when the elements
of sound are joined in correspondence with thought,
then language is produced. When feeling and emotion
is added to language and expressed, then song is created
and composed. Thus from Rks, thought energies of
consciousness composed in language, joined to
celebrative joy, Samans are created. When the music
and songs of joy are joined to practical situations in the
holy business of living, then Yajus are created as holy
formations of life’s values. And then from thought, song
and practical formulae in holy living the comprehensive
body of Atharva hymns is created. The classification of
Vedic knowledge is thus explained in terms of
and comprehensive message, Atharva-veda, which is
also known as Brahma Veda. In this way, from the
elements of energy, sound, thought, feeling and emotion


MANDAL - 1/SUKTA - 164 731


in divine consciousness, specially love and joy, all
language and linguistic compositions both divine and
human, sacred and secular, are created.)




25. Jagata sindhum divyastabhayad rathantare


The Lord establishes the ocean of energy in the
Dyu, the region of light, by cosmic dynamics of Jagati
hymns of omnipotence. In the Antariksha, He establishes
the sun, generative and radiating source of light and
energy. The blazing fire-woods of divine energy, they
say, are three: the sun in the highest sky, lightning, wind
and electricity in the atmosphere, and fire and magnetic
energy in the earth, and by His grand and adorable
omnipotence the Lord transcends all these. Of Gayatra,
the Samidhas are said to be three: light, lightning and
fire.




26. Upa hvaye sudugham dhenumetam suhasto


I invoke and call upon this generous mother cow,
Gayatri, Mother Nature, mother Sarasvati of knowledge,
directly at the closest. Only an intelligent and dexterous
person can distil the essence and power of her




generosity. May lord Savita, the creator, the sun, the
teacher, create the soma of milk, honey and the light of
knowledge for us and bless us. Lit up and blazing is the
fire in the yajna-vedi. The same I speak of and celebrate
in song.




27.  Himkrnvati vasupatni vasunam vatsamicchanti


Lowing and loving, this mother cow, sustainer
of the breath and supports of life, caressing her children
with her heart of tenderness, comes to bless us all round.
May she, never never to be killed or hurt, distil the milk
of life’s energy from the sun and wind and ever grow
for the great good fortune and prosperity of life on earth.




28. Gauramimedanu vatsam misantam murdhanam


The cow goes to the calf winking its eyes in
loving expectation, lowing with love, and licks its head
with caress. And lowing and loving more and more in
response to the yearning affection of the calf, she
overflows with milk. (The same is the response of
mother earth and mother Sarasvati to the children


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 164 733
yearning for love, nourishment and knowledge.)




29. Ayam sa Sinke yena gaurabhivrta mimati mayum


This is that cloud which roars and by which,
covered and surrounded in the vapours, the earth
reverberates in response. The earth, with her own
feelings of kindness and generosity sustains the mortal
children of hers, and her energy, being in the form of
lightning, reveals and realises her own form and
character.




30. Anacchaye turagatu jivamejad dhruvam madhya


Living and breathing, moving at the speed of
infinity yet constant and omnipresent, the Spirit of the
Universe abides eternal, impelling the individual soul
to move among the variety of material forms. And thus,
the immortal spirit of mortal man moves around in love
and company with the mortal forms of material beauty
by virtue of its karma and self sacrifice.






31. Apasyam gopam-anipadyamanam-a ca para ca


I pray I may see and realise that universal
protector of the world of nature and the mother powers
of life, who, ever infallible and immaculate, is immanent
and active over the nearest and the farthest paths of
existence, and, pervading the centripetal and centrifugal
waves of Prakrti, eternally rolls around in the worlds of
the universe.


Note: This mantra can be interpreted with
reference to the individual soul: I wish and pray I may
realise the essential nature of that presiding power over
the mind and senses which, though in association with
the mind and senses, never falls from its essence and
moves over the paths and forms of existence far and
near. The soul takes to the forms of Prakrti which, it
feels, go with it, as well as to those forms which are
various and disagreeable. And thus it goes round and
round in and across the worlds of the universe, integrated
with all living forms and yet essentially its own self.




32. Ya im cakara na so asya veda ya im dadarsa


That One that creates this universe, the other,
individual soul, knows not of. This other that sees this
world of existence goes off from the essence, and,
enveloped in the mothers womb, covered in the folds




of material form within, it is born and enters the world
of mortality for ages in birth after birth.




33. Dyaurme pita janita nabhiratra bandhurme mata


The heaven above is my father and creator, my
centre-hold, my haven and home here, my brother
support to stand by. And this great earth, this universe,
this nature, is my mother. In the womb of these two
great generative powers, heaven and earth, the mother
of His own creation in here, the father of the universe
sows the seed of life.




34. Prcechami tva paramantam prthivyah prcchami


What is the ultimate end of the earth? I ask you.
Where is the centre and centre-hold of the universe? I
ask you. What is the life-seed of the mighty generative
force of infinitive power and speed? I ask you. What is
the ultimate sound source from where the first boom of
the Word arises? I ask.






35. Iyam vedih paro antah prthivyad ayam yajno


This vedi, creativity and productivity of the
earth, is the ultimate end of the earth. This yajna, meeting
of solar vitality and earthly productivity, is the centre-
hold of life in the world. The vitality of the sun and the
shower of soma is the life seed of the generative energy
of the creator who is generous and infinite. And Brahma,
immanent consciousness of the Lord is the ultimate
home of the Word from where it incarnates in the world
as Veda.




36. Saptardhagarbha bhuvanasya reto 17510517 -


Seven evolutes of Prakrti, i.e., five subtle
elements, mind and senses (which evolve from
Ahankara), and the Mahat-tattva, represent half of the
divine process of creation (the other half being the
creative seed or thought-sankalpa of Parameshthi
Prajapati); they are half the womb of the universe the
other half is the divine will. By the will of Vishnu they
abide in Akasha, eternal space-and-time continuum with


MANDAL - 1/SUKTA - 164 737


their distinct properties and power and comprehend and
rule the entire worlds in existence.




37. Navijanami yadivedamasmi ninyah samn-addho


I just do not know what I am like for sure, or
what this world is. Self-imposed, self-bound, I move
around with limited mind and understanding. But when
the first evolutes of natural truth, 1.e., intelligence and
understanding of awareness come to me, and when the
revelations of this Divine Word of truth bless me, then
I realise my share of knowledge of the reality of
existence that it is.




38. Apan praneti svadhaya grbhito’martyo martyena


The immortal soul coexistent with the mortal
body goes back and forth. Both, body and soul, are
eternal and imperishable, the body as Prakrti in the
essence and the soul as spirit. Both are different and
going apart. Those who know know one and the other,
some know one but not the other, and those who don’t










The Rks, Vedas, exist in the omniscient supreme
Spirit of existence, infinite and imperishable as the
eternal and ultimate space-time continuum. In That, all
the divine powers of existence subsist. If one does not
know or acknowledge that, what would he or she
achieve with mere words of the Rks? Those who know
Him, reside with Him.




40. Suyavasad bhagavati hi bhuya atho vayam bhaga-


Adorable lady of knowledge and wisdom, be
great and illustrious with holy food for mind and spirit,
and then, we pray, we too may have the honour and
prosperity of knowledge and well-being. Holy and
inviolable as the mother cow, living on pure food and
drinking pure water, and conducting yourself with
kindness and grace, bless us with the generous gift of
universal knowledge and joy of life.

41. Gaurirmimaya salilani taksatyekapadi dvipadi sa


The lady of light in spotless white of the Word
in the highest heaven of eternal Omniscience, ever keen
to reveal and grow, speaks loud and bold, stirring the
stillness of space in waves of consciousness in the
universal mind and in the pools of the seer’s minds,
and thus reveals the Word in forms and stages for
humanity: One Veda as the whole knowledge, two Vedas
for knowledge and action, three Vedas for knowledge,
action and prayer, four Vedas as one compendium of
discrete forms, eightfold knowledge of four Vedas and
four Upa-Vedas of practical knowledge such as health
science, military science, etc., and nine-stage
knowledge, the ninth being grammar, phonetics,
astronomy, etc. Indeed, this is knowledge contained in
countless thousand variations of the One Imperishable




42.  Tasyah samudra adhi vi ksaranti tena jivanti


The oceanic showers of that voice of eternal
omniscience rain in torrents. With these showers the
directions, all the four and their sub-directions, vibrate
with life. Then from there the actual words reveal
themselves to human vision and perception, and the
entire world of humanity lives by that revelation with
light, support and guidance.






43. Sakamayam dhumamaradapasyam visuvata para


I have seen from close quarters the clouds of
smoke and vapour laden with power. From this close
by, I perceive the powerful catalytic agents of nature
far off busy heating and creating the clouds of soma
replete with vitality. These processes are the first
operations of natural evolution and behaviour higher
up in space.




44. Trayah keSina rtutha vi caksate samvatsare


Three powers of nature with their distinct
identities express themselves and operate according to
the cycle of the seasons in the year. One of these, fire, is
lit once in the year and generates and germinates the
seeds of life. Another the sun, with its action and
operations, illuminates the world. The third is wind, the
force of it can be perceived but not its shape and form.








Four are the constituent parts of speech which
the wise men of learning know. Three of them are hidden
in the cave of the mind, they are neither analysed, nor
defined, nor understood by ordinary speakers, only the
fourth part of speech, or parole, they use in


(The four constituents of the structure of speech
are: Nama or substantive, noun, Akhyata or roots of
verbs, Upasarga or affixes, and Nipata or irregular
accepted forms. These four are the subjects for
grammarians and linguists. For the ordinary person,
speech is the whole language, just what it is, and
accepted without the understanding of structure and
grammar. At a higher level, language is analysed in four
layers of existence and consciousness: Para or
transcendent language which is beyond thought and
understanding. It may be regarded as the language-
correspondence of the omniscience of God. The second
is Pashyanti, one step close to us from Para. This may
be understood to be the language existing in the
unconscious layers of the mind. The third is Madhyama,
another step closer to our consciousness. Let us say it
exists in our sub-conscious mind. And the fourth is
Vaikhari, existing at our conscious level of the mind.
This is the language in use. Further, this language is
Upasarga and Nipata. And of this language too the
ordinary speaker uses the accepted form without
knowing the structure and grammar. For the ordinary
speaker, the language in use is only behaviour purely at




the natural and social level. And in yet another way,
language may be understood in the way of the Veda:
Ila, the language of omniscience, Sarasvati, the language
of Veda and learning, Mahi, the spoken language at the
level of the earth, nation, region, family and the mother.
Another name for this speech is Bharati. And one thing
more at the end of this note: This analysis and study is
for the learned and for the seekers of learning. It has no
value for the ordinary speaker. He or she speaks what is
spoken for the only reason that he or she speaks thus,
and what is spoken is understood.)




46.  Indram mitram varunam-agnim-ahuratho divyah


Reality is one, Truth is one, Ishvara is one and
only One, not more than one. The learned and the wise
speak of It in many ways. They say: It is Indra, glorious,
light of life, Divya, heavenly, Suparna, supreme
is Agni, life and leader of existence, Yama, supreme
controller, law and justice, and the judge, and
Matarishva, supreme energy of the universe.

50. Yajnena yajnam-ayajanta devastani dharmani


The divinities, first evolutes of nature with the
immanent will Divine, conducted the yajna of creation
by yajna, yajnic inputs of self-sacrifice. They were the
first sustainers, supporters of the divine laws, keepers
of the rules of Dharma and carriers of the yajna further.
They alone attain to grandeur and rise to the regions
where the divine souls of the ancients dwell, who carry
on the yajna and serve the Lord of Heaven.

Indra and Maruts Devata, Agastya Maitravaruni Rshi






With what noble and equal action do the Maruts,
divine complementary energies, kindred powers of equal
age and home, join together, mix the yajna materials
for oblations and shower the earth with rain and
fragrance? With what thought and intelligence, and
coming from where do they, generous powers anxious
for the wealth of life, value and refine strength and
competence for the realisation of wealth?






kena maha manasa riramama.


Whose wealth do they, ever young, love and
delight in? Who enjoins the Maruts to visit and join the
yajna of love and non-violence? The Maruts traverse
the spaces like eagles sweeping across the skies. With
what great mind shall we serve and please them?






Indra, lord of might and grandeur, protector of
truth and right, you are so great, unique, still you go all
alone by yourself, without attendant, assistant or
retinue? Wherefrom? Where to? This way? What does
it mean? We ask you, friend and comrade, lord of
sunbeams, whatever is in your mind for us, pray speak
in good words.

O Maruts, tempestuous powers of knowledge,
speed and energy, where is that essential strength and
energy of yours which you placed in me to break the
clouds of rain showers by myself alone? Bright, blazing
and awful of power, I bow in homage to you with all
my fatal weapons of defence against the enemies of the
world and humanity. (The strength and energy is
everywhere in nature, in fire, water and electric and
magnetic force, and in the sunbeams. Let us exploit these


with knowledge and scientific technique.)




7. Bhuri cakartha yujyebhirasme samanabhirvr-


Indra, lord of power and generosity, with
nature’s energy harnessed for acts of general, universal

rule and govern.



11. Amandanma marutah stomo atra yanme narah






Friends, leaders, Maruts, may the hymns of Veda

overflowing generosity, we sing and celebrate your

advancing like warriors, do wondrous deeds of valour
worthy of admiration.






They bear the honey sweets of life for all as
parents bring honey to their darling child. Heroes of

of life, they come to the man of reverence and humility
with love and protection and, with all their innate

As you move on to reach the regions of your

automotive and tempestuous rockets rush forth through
the skies and spaces, then all the worlds and their towers
shake with terror. Amazing is that mission of flight in
the programmed and guided projects of yours.








When the man-made meteors of rockets blazing
through sky and space roar through mountains of earth
and clouds of dust and vapour, making them reverberate,
and thus reach the top of heaven, then all the bio-world
on your way shakes in fear and celestial herbs like soma
shake off from the root like astronauts floating from
their seat in the control chamber.




6. Yuyam na ugra marutah sucetuna’ristagramah


Maruts, powers young, dynamic and

matters of the promotion and advancement of his
children, save the man from sin and scandal.

inviolable is your discipline of vows as that of
imperishable Aditi. Whatever you grant and bestow on
the man of noble action, even Indra commanding the




13. Tad vo jamitvam marutah pare yuge puru


O Maruts, immortal souls, that brotherhood of
yours, that joy and suffering of yours in the last age,
that high honour and reputation you earned and
preserved, the same honour and reputation, protect and
preserve with this intelligence and understanding of
yours for humanity and further extend and preserve with
your noble actions in company with men and leaders.






14. Yena dirgham marutah susavama yusmakena


O Maruts, heroes of instant action and
achievement, that abundance, expertise and heroism of
yours by virtue of which we achieve great things of
lasting significance, by which people expand in
knowledge and win victories in their battles of life, that
very cherished abundance, expertise and power of
action, I pray, I too may achieve by these yajnic




15. Esa vah stomo maruta iyam girmandaryasya


O Maruts, heroes of instant action, universal
knowledge and abundant generosity, this is the song of
celebration in honour of your action and achievement.
This is the spontaneous voice of the happy and honoured
poet artist. May it reach you for the manifestation of
your form and image in existence for our benefit so that
we may acquire food and energy for our body, mind
and spirit, clear our paths of advancement and achieve
abundance in life for a vibrant living.




Mandala 1/Sukta 167
Indra-Maruts Devata, Agastya Maitravaruni Rshi




1. Sahasram ta indrotayo nah sahasramiso harivo


Lord of power and sustenance, Indra, thousands
are your protections and ways of protection for us. Lord
of sunbeams, thousand-fold are the foods and energies
of the most admirable order. Thousands are your gifts of
wealth for us to enjoy life. And thousands may be, we
pray, the forms of knowledge, valour and victory for us.




2. A no’vobhirmaruto yantvaccha jyesthebhirva


May the Maruts, heroes of the winds, powers
of vision and wonder as they are, come well to us with
their modes of protection and senior-most scholars of
brilliance, and then may follow those of their most
efficient modes of transport which can cross the seas
and skies for the acquisition of wealth.








Seeker of knowledge, go and mix with those
scholars and visionaries among whom exists that noble
and comprehensive language which is fit for scientific
yajnas of versatile purpose, which is fit for use in
councils of governance, which is peacefully held like
the dewy night by the sky, which is held like a golden
sword by the warrior, which is held like lightning by
the cloud, and which, like the youthful maiden of the
human lover, moves in covert allays in search of the
lover. (Such is living speech.)




4. Para subhra ayaso yavya sadharanyeva maruto


Distant but brilliant and powerful, moving at
moderate speed, the Maruts shower the earth and sky
with rain, but even when they are violent, roaring with
lightning, they are not repulsive, they are only impulsive,
not repelling the sky and the earth away but impelling
them with new life and energy, because the divines love
to mix and join in a spirit of commonalty for the sake of
friendship and love the growth and expansion of all in
power and potential.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 167 761




If the earth, source of pranic vitality and loving
mother of mankind, were to serve the Maruts for the
sake of waters, then she, with flowing hair like the lights
of evening dawn, shining brilliant as child of the sun,
would ride the chariot of the Lord Ordainer and
sustainer, 1.e., the sun, and rise as if going to sky heights
of progress and abundance.



6. Asthapayanta yuvatim yuvanah subhe nimislam

When the worshipper, rich in yajnic offerings,
having distilled the soma, sings songs of praise zealously
in honour of you, then, O Maruts, youthful powers of
nature’s brilliance and force, you give him in marriage
a young maiden, smart and dynamic, dedicated to yajnas,
and a harbinger of happiness and bliss in life.






That greatness and glory of the Maruts which is




worthy of celebration, I celebrate. It is real and true,
since he that is virile and proud of himself, Indra, in
unison with this firm earth, sustains the many happy
mothers and children of the world.




8. Panti mitravarunavavadydccayata imaryamo


Mitra and Varuna protect from sin and shame.
Surely Aryama, lord of justice, raises the despicable.
They shake off even the firm and fixed enemies of life.
O Maruts, the gift of your generosity ever grows and




0. Nahi nu vo maruto antyasme arattaccicchavaso


O Maruts, neither from near nor from afar do
they find the end of your power and force. Intrepidable
and rising with inviolable strength and courage, they,
i.e., the Maruts keep the enemies down and, vast as the
ocean, they stay and abide far higher than jealousy and
calumny of small minds.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 168 763


10. Vayamadyendrasya prestha vayam 510 vocemahi


We are the dearest children of Indra to-day. Let
us be able to say the same thing tomorrow in the battles
of life. And for the sake of this love and grace of Indra,
let us first maintain our own greatness of character and
performance day by day, and then, we pray, may Indra
be kind and favourable day by day among men. Lord of




11. Esa vah stomo maruta iyam girmandaryasya


O Maruts, this is your song of celebration, this

is the voice of the happy and honoured poet artist. May

it reach you for the manifestation of your image and


action for us. And may we, we pray, achieve food and
energy, advancement in action and the joy of life.


Mandala 1/Sukta 168
Maruts Devata, Agastya Maitravaruni Rshi







O Maruts, powers of enlightenment, generous
action and well-being of the world, in every act of yajna
one after another, let your will and performance be equal,
fast and victorious. In every act of thought, reflection
and planning, let your intelligence, understanding and
imagination, and even your calculation be divinely holy.
For the well-being of the earth and heaven, and for the
sake of great and inviolable protection of life and life’s
joy, with yajnic oblations and songs of praise and
thankfulness, we pray, turn your attention this way for
our good and well-being by straight and simple speed
of motion.






Come this way, Maruts! Powers ever on the
move for protection and progress of us all, self-creative,
self-strong, movers and shakers like a thousand waves
of the rolling seas, they are born to provide nourishment,
energy, light and happiness for others. Worthy of honour
and reverence they are like generous cows who provide
motherly milk for sustenance and growth, and like the
sacrificing bullocks who carry the burdens of humanity.
Admirable, worthy of thanks and praise with honest
word of the mouth they are.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 168 165




Maruts, vibrant powers of enlightenment,
nourishment and protection, like soma, with off-shoots
spreading around, distilled and drunk to the last drop
of the essence assimilated into the heart, abide with us,
loved, honoured and admired as our own. I depend on
their shoulders for support as a housewife depends upon
the support of the head of family. And in their hands,
the Maruts hold action in one and wear the band of
victory on the other.






Self-inspired, self-motivated and self-driven,
Maruts descend from the heights of heaven freely,
spontaneously and selflessly. Immortal are you, mighty
heroes, inspire and excite the will to live with your heart
and soul and use the will as a goal and an invitation to
life. Pure and unsullied, born of energy and impetuous
in motion, wielding weapons of light and lightning, O
Maruts, you stir and move even the fixed and immovable








O Maruts, wielders of arms blazing as light and
lightning, who or what in you shakes and shines in you
by itself like flames or waves of sound? Inspirers of
many, augmenters of food, energy and love of life, who
starts you on your mission of life like the cloud melting
in the sky or like a fast horse on its daily round?




6. Kva svidasya rajaso mahasparam kvavaram


O Maruts, what is the ultimate beyond this great
region of the skies, and what is the ultimate this side
wherein you move hither and shake the things
concentrated here like precarious objects of no value,
or fly down with the clouds to the shining seas?




7. Satirna vo’mavati svarvati tvesa vipaka marutah

Like your acquisition and distribution is your


generosity and benevolence, powerful, blissful, lustrous,
maturing and fruitful, abundant, auspicious, as the gift


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 168 767


of a philanthropist yajamana, expansive and victorious
like the breeze of life’s energy.

8. Prati stobhanti sindhavah pavibhyo yadabhri-


When the Maruts ride their chariots, the wheels
rumble with thunder of the clouds and oceans pant and
roll in awe, and when they shower torrents or rain on
the earth, flashes of lightning flaunt with pride and lights
of joy.






Mother Nature creates the blazing force of the
tempestuous Maruts for the great battle of the elements
in the process of evolution, and they, moving and
working together with the waves of creative energy,
fashion forms earlier not in existence and watch the
achievements of their own powers all round in the midst
of the variety of creative materials.






10. Esa vah stomo maruta iyam girmandaryasya


This is the song of the Maruts in celebration of
their work and power in the world of nature and
humanity in evolution. This is the voice of the poet,
happy and honoured artist, maker of beautiful forms.
May this, with love and homage of the poet, reach the
Maruts for their manifestation in form and image, and
may we too achieve food and energy, vision and will to
move on clear and simple paths of progress, and may we
have the bliss of the breeze of freshness and light of life.


Mandala 1/Sukta 169
Indra Devata, Agastya Maitravaruni Rshi






Indra, lord of knowledge and power, destroyer
of suffering, you are great and glorious indeed, since
you accept and honour and protect these great saints
and scholars for the reason of their selflessness and
dynamic scholars and knowing what is dearest to you
and the Maruts, fastest leaders of society, pray give us
the peace and comfort of perfect well-being.






2. Ayujranta indra visvakrstir vidanaso nissidho


Indra, lord of honour and glory, that dedicated
force of yours consisting of the Maruts, intelligent,
creative and war-like leaders among ordinary mortals,
smiling, happy and joyful, may, we pray, join and engage
entire humanity in the battle of creative production of
wealth and well-being for the lord creator of paradisal






May the fruits of that loving and generous
creativity of yours, by which the Maruts create perfect
joyous gifts of life from pre-existing causes, which gifts,
like the blazing fire in the wood and waters in the open-
ended flowing rivers and space, abide in nature, and
which gifts, then, the living beings enjoy as the dearest
gifts of life (by virtue of the creative dynamics of the



4. Tvam tu na indra tam rayim da ojisthaya




Indra, glorious lord of wealth, give us that
wealth of life as a gift with the highest generosity of
heart and magnanimity of mind which is honoured by
the beneficiaries, that wealth and generosity of yours
and the Maruts’ which all people love, and which, like
the honey sweet milk of the mother’s breast, nourishes
the child with food, energy and intelligence.




2. Tve raya indra tosatamah pranetarah kasya


Indra, in you and with you abide wealths and
virtues of the world which are most satisfying saviours
and redeemers, which help any lover of truth, piety and
yajna keen to cross the oceans of existence to liberation.
May the Maruts give us that peace and wealth. May the
ancient and eternal nobilities eager to rise to divinity
guide and bless us.



6. Prati pra yahindra milhuso nrn mahah parthive




Indra, lord of power, knowledge and action, go
forward to the great, virile and generous people, fast,
intelligent and vibrant as the winds, and try experiments
on the floor of this great earth. And then, just as the




powers and transports of the master stand ready at his
service, so would the mighty and spacious flying
machines like horses would stand ready for the heroes
of the skies.






I hear the echoes of the roar of awful and
impetuous Maruts reaching their target and returning—
Maruts which, with the creation and release of fresh
energy and modes of protection, exhort and accelerate
the speed of humanity on way to progress like an army
advancing to victory.




8. Tvam manebhya indra visvajanya rada maru-


Indra, lord of light and power, adored by
admirers of brilliance and generosity, for the sake of
honour and prestige and in honour of the venerables,
split and know the sun-light headed powers of nature
such as waters and herbs with the help of the Maruts,
catalytic, analytical and universally creative energy
waves of nature, and let us know and acquire wealth of
food, energy, onward progress and the breath and
freshness of life.




Mandala 1/Sukta 170
Indra Devata, Agastya Maitravaruni Rshi






Nothing that is present is permanent, nor what
shall be is constant. Who knows what, in truth, is
mysterious: serial yet constant, and constant yet elusive?
It is someone else’s mind and consciousness you should
be with, otherwise what you know or think you know,
that too would fade into the unknown.




2. Kim na indra jighamsasi bhrataro marutastava.


Indra, lord of earth and ocean, master of the
skies, why do you wish to forsake us? The Maruts are
your brethren, they are heroes of earth and ocean and
the skies. With them, plan and act with noble intentions.
Do not destroy us in the battle of life.






MANDAL - 1/SUKTA - 170 773


Brother Agastya, pioneer of vision, insight and
foresight, you are our friend. Being a friend, why do
you disdain us? Don’t you want to give us the secret of




4. Aram krnvantu vedim samagnim-indhatam purah.


Indra, let the priests prepare and decorate the
vedi and light the holy fire as before. And there in the
vedi you and we all, teachers and disciples, would
conduct and expand your yajna of the immortal spirit,
knowledge and divine consciousness.






Indra, spirit of the universe, master of the
worlds, lord protector of the sustainers of life, highest
wielder of the wealth of the world, you rule, govern
and ordain the honour and grandeur of existence. Lord
protector of friends and friends of life, you rule, govern
and ordain all the powers and energies that protect,
preserve and promote the evolution and onward march
of life and humanity. Lord of knowledge and power,
speak to the Maruts, dynamic powers of nature and
humanity, accept our offers of oblations, consume them
in the yajna fire, and create the life-giving vapours of




energy and showers of rain according to the seasons.


Mandala 1/Sukta 171
Maruts Devata, Agastya Maitravaruni Rshi




1. Prati va ena namasadhamemi suktena bhikse


O Maruts, dynamic powers of nature and
humanity, bearers of light, knowledge and power, with
this homage and song of celebration and reverence, I
come to you and pray for my share of noble thoughts
and intelligence from the excellent priests and
preceptors. O dynamic scholars of power and force, and
of the light of life, keep you anger and passion aside
and, exulting in the onward march of humanity, release
the powers of progress by the freedom and initiative
that comes with knowledge and conscious values of life
and love.


O Maruts, vibrations of the divine in nature and
humanity, this song of celebration and reverence is risen


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 171 175


from the heart and crafted with love and beauty. O
visionaries of divinity, take it with the same equal love
with which it is offered. Take to the spirit of it with
your heart and mind, come close bearing your gifts of
life and energy, advance us onward, and stay with us,
because you are the veterans of eminence and progress
for the love of living with gifts of divinity.





O Maruts, veteran visionaries of life and
divinity, powers of knowledge for advancement,
admired and honoured as you are, pray give us peace
and well-being. Indra, lord of honour and glory, listen
to our prayer and worship, and bless us with peace and
prosperity. Maruts, heroes of tempestuous speed and
energy, let all our future days be distinguished by high
ambition, cherished goals and love of victory.




4. Asmadaham tavisadisamana indrad bhiya maruto

O Maruts, heroes of energy, power and speed,


shining with strength and power and, at the same time,
conscious and moved by the awe of this blazing lord




Indra and his law, I say, these holy materials of yajna
are dedicated to you, these weapons and armaments are
tempered and sharpened for you. We offer these right
here. Accept these, we pray, and make us happy and
comfortable with peace and well-being.






By the strength and courage by which the
veterans of knowledge and enlightenment instruct and
educate the ancient and constant citizens of the ancient
and constant republics in their ancestral habitations, by
the same strength and courage, O Indra, ruler of the
land, generous and valorous, bright and blazing, old
and venerable, giver of strength and constancy, give us
food, energy, power, and honour with the help of the
Maruts, mighty and formidable leaders and warriors of
the land.

Indra, lord of power, honour and glory, ruler of
the world, patient, constant and victorious, protect and
promote the men of strength, courage and endurance.


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 172 777


With the help of the Maruts, lustrous guardians and
watchful protectors of the people, be free from anger
and disdain of impatience and despair. Wielder of power
and presiding power of the social order as you are, let
us have knowledge and enlightenment, strength and
courage of will and morals, and the light and vision of
the spirit of life and joy.


Mandala 1/Sukta 172
Maruts Devata, Agastya Maitravaruni Rshi






O Maruts, lights of the dark, breakers of the
clouds, showers of soothing charities, may your progress
be fast and wonderful, may your protections and
promotions of society be wondrous, full of blessings.




2. Are sa vah sudanavo maruta rnjati Saruh.
Are asma yamasyatha.


O Maruts, courageous brothers of charity, givers
of bliss and protection like winds and lightning, may
that missile of yours, which you throw like thunderbolt
upon the destroyers, and the deadly double edged sword
you wield against the powers of darkness, be far away
from us for our protection against evil.








Maruts, generous powers of charity and valour,
spare the and protect men of straw, take to the rural
settlements and raise us all to the heights of life.


Mandala 1/Sukta 173
Indra Devata, Agastya Maitravaruni Rshi






Let the holy man sing spontaneous songs of
joyous Sama like the song of the bird soaring to the
clouds, and we shall join that resounding melody of
music overflowing with divine ecstasy, when the rays
of the dawn, generous like venerable holy cows, sacred
and inviolable, fill the vault of the sky and celebrate
the heavenly sun rising in splendour over the world and
the generous cows stir around the stalls and sit on the
holy grass around the yajnic area doing homage to Indra.






MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 173 7719


Let the brilliant man of yajna, virile and
generous, trying to reach his aim like a bounding deer
at the fastest speed, with virile and generous yajakas,
offer rich, fragrant yajnic offerings, to Indra. Let the
mortal man, happy at heart with his life partner dedicated
to yajna and social service, offer hymns of praise and
fragrant oblations to Indra, lord of life, honour and glory.






Let the yajakas, Indra, fire and power, divine
energy, receiver and giver, receive the oblations and rise
by the vedi constructed in definite design and measure,
bearing the essences of the earth’s produce the year
round according to the seasons, and in return replenish
the earth with fertility. Let the power arise and go over
a bull, and moving on the rounds like a messenger
between heaven and earth, echoing the voice of divinity
raised from the seats of yajna.


4. Ta karmasatarasmai pra cyautnani devayanto




Those yajnic acts, cherished offerings, and
mantras vibrating with energy, which the yajakas eager




to please and empower the divinities of nature and
humanity offer into the fire for Indra, may Indra, blazing
catalytic power of Divinity, happily accessible, riding
the chariot of sun-beams, along vibrations of the winds
and waves of energy, receive with love and desire and,
like the Ashvins, sun and moon, recreate, augment and
return as blessings of Divinity for humanity.




2. Tamu stuhindram yo ha satva yah suro maghava


Praise be to Indra, celebrate Him in gratefulness.
He alone is wholly pure and true. He is mighty and
omnipotent. His is the power and the glory. He rides
the chariot of the universe as the sole master. Right in
front, He is in and with everyone and everything, the
great fighter, shower of life and joy, and He is the Light,
dispeller of the darkness that hides the truth.

6. Pra yadittha mahina nrbhyo astyaram rodasi


Indra who, thus with His omnipotence, is all in

keeps the heaven and earth and the middle regions in
orbit but not for Himself, Indra who weaves the web


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 173 781


and wields the entire worlds of existence together, each
as on its own path, and then the mighty lord of His own
power and Prakrti holds the high heavens up above as
the pillar in the centre.






To decorate and honour you as a mighty hero,
as a pioneer and leader in the battles of life, as the highest
of the best, O sagely wise Indra, lord omnipotent and
omniscient, the people of the world, friends, lovers,
admirers and worshippers in excitement and ecstasy
celebrate you and the worlds, and celebrate with you,
with all their might and main and the homage of love
and faith.




om Eva hi te Sam savana samudra apo yat ta asu

O Indra, lord ruler of the world, all celebrations
in your honour and all your celebrations of life and
existence, thus, are for peace and well-being. Thus all
waters in the oceans and all celestial waters in space
and in these earths of the universe which celebrate you
and rejoice in you are for peace and well-being. And




when you inspire sagely people with conscious favours
and divine intelligence, then all voices of the world in
unison with you celebrate you and the joy of existence.

Lord of knowledge, divine action and human
progress, guide us the way we may be blest with good
friends and allies, with noble aims and intentions as
with good wishes and approbations of the people
around, and the way that Indra, happy with our praise
and worship, be with us always, taking us forward in
action like a carrier rocket in the holy field of science
and technology.




10. Vispardhaso naram na samsair-asmakasad-indro


As with the praise and prayers of people trying
to excel and rise in life, so with our praise and prayers
may Indra, lord of armaments and the thunderbolt, be
with us as a friend and guide. Like men with desire for
friends, and like people of experience at the middle of
age who serve Indra, lord of the city, with yajnas and sit
with him for the sake of auspicious learning, we too


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 173 783


serve the lord with yajnic offerings, meditate and pray
for learning in the field of science and administration.




11. Yajno hi smendram kascidrndhanjuhuranascin-


Some yajna is good for success and glorifies
Indra, social order of governance and the ruler. A
tortuous path, though apparently yajnic and good, repels
the seeker mentally and emotionally. A good home close
by in a place of pilgrimage is good for the thirsty
traveller, but a long and tortuous path is no use, it does




12. Mo su na indratra prtsu devairasti hi sma te


Indra, lord of power and prosperity, you are with
the divinities of nature and nobilities of humanity, never
with the ungenerous. Pray, do not forsake us in the
battles of life. Lord of light and grandeur, this praise
and prayer is for you surely, this voice of unifying love
and faith which celebrates the great, generous, creative,
philanthropic and dynamic powers of the divine and
human world is for you.






13. Esa stoma indra tubhyamasme etena gatum


Indra, lord of power and glory, thus our song of

of life.

Indra, lord of light, you are the ruler, lord of life
and giver of energy. You and those powers and
personalities that are generous and brilliant in nature
and humanity protect us and the people. You are the
protector of truth. You are the lord of wealth and glory
of the world. You are our saviour, you are the truth of
existence. You are the shelter and support of all that is.
You are the strength and the giver of strength and


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 174 785




2. Dano visa indra mrdhravacah sapta yat purah


You subdue and bring under rule the people who
are violent in social discourse. You open the seven cities
and the homes therein locked in winter snow. Lord
adorable free from scandal, you break the cloud for rain
showers and let the river waters flow for the sunny world
of young humanity.






Immortal Indra, destroyer of suffering, elected
and invoked by all, surely you drive high up to the lights
of heaven with the Maruts, tempestuous powers of
nature and humanity. With the same powers, like a lion,
pray protect the brave women of the land. Preserve the
inextinguishable fire that moves high speed vehicles to
their destination. Keep the morning fires burning and
let the waters of the home flow on and on.


4. Sesan nu ta indra sasmin yonau prasastaye






Indra, lord of war for humanity, for your honour
and glory, let the enemies fall and go to sleep on the
battle-field by the awful roar of your thunderbolt, while
you ride the chariot and release the floods of attack with
the force of action, destroy the resistance of opposition
and then hold the lands in peace and security.






Indra, lord of world power, wielder of the force
of thunder, keen for the reins and thirsting for the heart’s
desire, take up the thunderbolt, ride the horses of the
winds shooting straight to the target, and go to the battle
you love to fight. So should the ruler, strong of arm and
will, blazing as the sun, meet the contending enemies
in battle and expand the wheel of the social order.




6. Jaghanvan indra mitrerun-codapravrddho harivo


Indra, lord of love and justice, inspired and self-
exalted, master of horses of the wind, is destroyer of
the betrayers of friends and selfish exploiters. Lord of
honour and glory, those who see you as lord of justice
and generosity and as friend of humanity are blest with
progeny and family and they are strengthened and


MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 174 787
confirmed as brave and heroic by you.






In the distribution of food and land, let the man
of knowledge and insight speak fully and freely, and
then Indra, lord of land, should allot fertile land to the
servant class. The lord of wealth and power should fix
creative and productive duties and occupations for the
other three, and him who is evil of tongue, he should
take on in battle of arms or words in the open field.




8. Sana ta ta indra navya aguh saho nabho’viranaya


Indra, lord of power and glory, ruler of the
world, let the latest poets and citizens know and sing of
your famous acts of valour, justice and generosity with
universal courage. You have suppressed the old
established strongholds of violence for the elimination
of war and establishment of peace. You have broken
the dens of sin and crime like the citadels of ancient
demons, and you have destroyed the deadly weapons
of the terrorist enemies of humanity.






9. Tvam dhunirindra dhunimatirrnorapah sira na


Indra, lord of life and energy, you are a mover
and shaker like the inspiration of soma and the speed of
winds, shaking people out of lethargy and complacency.
You set the waters aflow, shaking and overflowing the
banks. Reach the people like roaring streams or like
life-blood circulating through the veins of wealth and
work. And, O lord of might and knowledge, if you swell
the sea to the shores like the sun, then help the man of
endeavour and the man of self-controlled speed and
acceleration to cross the sea from shore to shore.




10. Tvam-asmakam-indra visvadha sya avrkatamo


Indra, lord of power and force, honour and glory,
justice and generosity, be every way the most giving,
most protecting and least wolfish greedy ruler of us all.
And as such, be the giver of strength, courage and
constancy in all our endeavour for the good life and
joint competitive and cooperative living so that we are
blest with food, energy and prosperity, the right path of
living and the right spirit of life.

Indra Devata, Agastya Maitravaruni Rshi






Indra, lord of energy and paradisal bliss, rejoice.
You have drunk of the great and exhilarating soma, the
divinity and ecstasy of life fresh from the very flask of
existence. Vibrant lord of the knights of horse, that joy
of the drink of life is exciting, the very thrill of being.
Lord virile and generous, you are the shower of bliss
and that soma is soothing like the moon, tempestuous
as waves of energy, yes, and a thousand-fold invitation
to live, the call of life, for you. (The call of life is the
call of existence for the human soul too to be born into
this wonderful world of beauty, joy and peace.)



2. A naste gantu matsaro vrsa mado varenyah.


O for a draught of soma, that exciting, ener-
and immortal nectar of yours, Indra, which leads us on
to victory over all the antilife forces of the world! May
it come to us in plenty!








Indra, ruler and protector of the world, great you
are, valiant and generous, dispenser, disposer, giver and
unifier. Inspire and accelerate the chariot of humanity.
Heroic and courageous lord of challenges, burn the
lawless brute with your light and lustre of justice as the
blaze of fire burns an empty vessel on the hearth
(because there is nothing in it except its empty self).




4. Musaya suryam kave cakramisana ojasa.


Having taken over the wheel of earth’s
government with your lustre like the blazing sun, O Lord
of light, vision and wisdom, wield the thunderous
sceptre of power and justice with honour and hold the
system of law and punishment under your control,
moving on by horses flying on the wings of winds.






Highly strengthening and most reassuring is
your joy. Holiest and most blissful giver of wealth and
prosperity is your action and conduct of government
and administration. O destroyer of suffering and
darkness, lord of speediest movement and communi-
cation, giver of peace, freedom and security, think,

reflect and know the mind and working of others with
sympathy and self-confidence.

Indra, lord of honour, power and glory, be like
water to the thirsty. Be like peace and joy incarnate to
the admirers of eternal knowledge and worshippers of
the divine virtues of yours. In the tradition of ancient
knowledge, I honour and celebrate you with this song
of adoration by which, I hope and pray, we shall realise
the objects of our heart’s desire, the right path of living
and the spiritual light of being.


Mandala 1/Sukta 176
Indra Devata, Agastya Maitravaruni Rshi






Indra, lord of justice and peace blissful as the
moon, rejoice and rise to honour and glory for our
advancement to higher and higher wealth and power.
Progressive lord, you advance upon the enemy and
overpower him and prevent him even from approaching
us.






2. Tasminna vaSaya giro ya ekascarsaninam.


Send up your voices of praise and prayer with
reverence and homage to him who is powerful,
generous, and unique among men, in whom words bear
fruit as barley sowed in the field bears fruit, and who
mows down the enemies as corn is harvested from the





Indra, lord of power and honour, in your hands
is the wealth of the entire world, wealth of all the five
classes of people, four of the regular classes, Brahmanas,
Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and the ancillary class and one
class of miscellaneous people and professions anywhere.
Lord of the world, whosoever is jealous of us and evil-
disposed toward us, take hold of him and, like the
flashing and blazing lightning, strike him down.

such, is difficult to change or eliminate, wipe out wholly
and finally. Assign him to us, we shall find him and
deal with him. Only the wise and generous carry the
burdens of society and the world.






Indra, lord of power, protection and progress,
protect and promote the man who accords with all the
praises and appreciations of the nation’s achievement
and creates and grows in geometric progression. Lord

development, and in the battles for justice and freedom,
protect and promote the man of courage, dynamism
and dedication.

Indra, lord of light, energy and the honour of

of command and control at the remotest distance, come
with and come by the powers that move faster than even
light and come here where we pray. The time is ripe,
the soma is distilled and ready for celebration of the
success and divine visit.






Indra, potent lord of fertility and universal
generosity, ride your celestial chariot and come. Distilled

around the vedi, ready for the celebration. O potent and
generous lord of the people, yoke the two most energetic
powers of motion to the chariot and come right here to
us by the shortest route at the fastest speed.



4. Ayam yajno devaya ayam miyedha ima brahma-

Indra, generous and powerful lord ruler of the
world, this is the yajna that leads to divine heights of




existential success. This is the yajna that grows by holy
inputs of fragrant materials. These are the materials and
mantric formulas of libation. And this is the soma of
the celebration of success. The vedi is covered round
with holy grass for seats. Lord of potency and generosity,
come, release the horses, sit and drink of the soma of
celebration and success.




5. O sustuta indra yahyarvanupa brahmani manya-


Indra, lord of light and life, ruler of the world,

MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 178 797


Indra, lord of power and protection, all that
reputable knowledge and wealth of yours by which you
become the protector and promoter of the celebrants
may not, we pray, scorch and burn our exalting ambition
in life. May we, instead, achieve all your blessings of
life and energy for our existence and progress.






May Indra, lord of life, action and success, we
pray, suppress us not any way, nor negate what our
sisters achieve in the home or in the yajna on the vedi.
Instead, let the lord of the world, we pray, make the
waters of life flow free for us, and let our achievements
rise high for his sake. May Indra, we pray, bless us with
health and the good life and grant us the favour of divine




2. Jeta nrbhirindrah prtsu surah srota havam nadha-


Great is Indra, mighty brave, victor in battles of

prayers provided that everything is prayed for and
pursued with sincerity of mind and soul.




4. Eva nrbhirindrah susravasya prakhadah prkso


Thus Indra is great with human resources, lord
of wealth, honour and high reputation, great consumer
of materials and thereby producer of high energy, and
he is always surrounded and assisted by friends and
associates. In debates and discussions of variety he
values food and energy as the basic wealth. He is a great
organiser of sessions of yajnic conferences and
appreciates and applauds the host of such sessions and






Indra, lord of honour, wealth and power, with
you let us face and overcome our enemies, great and
highly proud though they believe they are. You are our
saviour and promoter. You alone, we pray, be here and

Dampati Devata, Lopamudra (1-2) Agastya
Maitravaruni (3-4), and Agastya disciple Brahmachari






Working for the last many many years from
dawn through the day until the dark late at night, tired
and worn out, growing old and older, now old age
destroys the health and beauty of the body of women.
Therefore the young and virile husband should meet
the wife only earlier when she is young and charming.






Those ancients who were masters and devout
followers of truth spoke of the laws and truth of nature
with men of divinity. They did procreate, but they too
did not find the end of the mystery. Let the women go
and meet their youthful and virile husbands.








The vexations of the household are not vain
since nature and the divines protect and bless it. Let us
together face the problems and win the battles of the
world. We shall win the hundredfold battles if we, the
wedded couple, were to beget progeny and fulfil our
duties of the household.




4. Nadasya ma rudhatah kama agannita ajato


Passion and desire arises in me like the waters
of a river held up but rising in flood from here, there,
anywhere, who knows? Hiding but not suppressing the
passion, the amorous wife betakes to the husband
breathing deep and calm and smothers him in embrace.




5. Imam nu somamantito hrtsu pitamupa bruve. Yat


I have closely spoken of this soma of ecstatic
passion from the inner reality of it, drunk and felt as it
is in the depths of the heart. If I have committed a sin,
please forbear and forgive. Man after all is subject to


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 180 801


various passion, and desire (for self-fulfilment), mortal
as he is.




6. Agastyah khanamanah khanitraih prajama-


Agastya, the sagely man of vision, brilliance and
resolution never goes astray. Digging into the mysteries
of life with the instruments of intelligence and insight
he longs for strength and children and a controlled
family and community. He marries by choice and looks
after and promotes the duad, both sexes in the
community, and thus attains complete self-fulfilment
among noble people dedicated to truth and Divinity.


Mandala 1/Sukta 180
Ashvins Devata, Agastya Maitravaruni Rshi






Men and women all, wedded couples, Ashwins,
when your well controlled and guided horses soar into
the skies and the chariot shoots over oceans of earth
and space, your golden wheels cut through the air and
drip with vapour, then both of you enjoy the honey drink


of the lights of dawn.






Ashvins, men and women, universally
admirable, enjoying the honey sweets of life and nature,

Ashvins, leaders of men and women, you
brighten up the day and create the flow of water
invigorating as the breath of life, all sweet as honey for
the man who longs for freedom from three-fold suffering
of body, mind and soul. And thus the fruits of animal
husbandry and sericulture, animal wealth and honey
sweets of nature move on to you as freely as the wheels
of your chariot.






Ashvins, adorable friends of all, like an old and
worn out person, like a strong man among the strong,
by virtue of the gifts of mother earth I come to you for
the gift of strength and sustenance. By virtue of your
greatness and generosity the earth has the rain showers.
Friends and benefactors, let me be free from sin and
suffering even when I am old and tired and be with you
for long.




6. Ni yad yuvethe niyutah sudanu upa svadhabhih


Ashvins, generous givers, when you join the
materials which ought to be compounded, you create
new knowledge with inputs into the fire. Let the bold

For the sake of peace and well-being and the
beauty of life, O Ashvins, powers of progress and
majesty, today we invoke and call for that latest chariot
of yours which takes us far above the pain and suffering
of the world and reaches the heights of heavenly light,
and we pray we may attain food and energy, the right
path of living and the light and peace of the soul.


Mandala 1/Sukta 181
Ashvins Devata, Agastya Maitravaruni Rshi







Dearest Ashvins, source and wielders of the
treasures of wealth, saviours and protectors of humanity,
ever keen to organise and conduct the yajnic
development of water, energy and wealth, when you
advance to the non-violent projects of development, you
take the results to the heights of success. This yajna
does honour to you both.





Ashvins, powers of might and majesty, may your
horses, pure unsullied, living on drink of milk and water,
moving as winds, brilliant and divine, fast as the speed
of mind, strong and virile, carriers like the back of the
earth, brilliant with their own lustre bear you here.
SIU Bu


Ashvins, benevolent powers of high standing,
may your chariot firmly rushing on like the earth,

strongly structured and beautifully adorned, faster than
mind, fully programmed and self-directed, cooperative
and inviolably un-interceptible reach us for our good.




4. Theha jata sam-avavaSsitam-arepasa tanva


Ashvins, pure geniuses unsullied by sin and evil,
risen to universal recognition here, there, everywhere,
be ambitious in accordance with your body and your
own name and character. One of you is ambitious for
victory and advancement. Another is a mighty scholar,
a very child of the benevolent light of heaven. And yet
another is an auspicious favourite of fortune, a saviour
just like a son. I think and deliberate upon this variety
and mystery.






Ashvins, tempestuous powers like sun-rays and
winds, one chariot of yours, golden of form, goes round
conquering the directions of space and reaching the places
of your choice. The horses of the other shear through
space churning the air with the force of their speed and


fill the world with reverberations of their motion.




6. Pra vam saradvan vrsabho na nissat purviri-


Ashvins, one of you, mighty like the sun, lord
of the seasons and the year or like the autumn cloud,
challenging the winds and vapours and loving the all-
time sweets of earth, travels down with the rays of light
and plays with the fruits and flowers. The other,
consuming and growing by the motions and energies
of another moving like upward streams of fire, brings
us peace and comfort.






Ashvins, most venerable lords of knowledge and
wisdom, this ancient and expansive song of celebration
flowing three ways over time for the sake of growth,
physical, mental and spiritual, has been created in your
honour. Sung and celebrated sincerely, listen to the voice
of the celebrant while on the move or not on the move
and redeem and protect the devotee.




MANDAL - 1 /SUKTA - 182 809


of Uta sya vam rusato vapsaso gistribarhisi sadasi


And that voice celebrating the brilliant and
charming form of your personality strengthens and
energises the people performing yajna in the ceremonial
hall of three sages seated on holy grass. And the same
voice, holy and generous lords, while it blesses the
people, may shower you with joy as showers of rain
from the heavy clouds overflow the surface of the earth
in the rainy season.




9. Yuvam pusevasvina purandhir-agnim-usam na


Ashvins, powers of light, energy and generosity,
just as the sun which sustains the world nourishes the
earth and her children and the yajamana bearing
oblations does homage to Agni and the Dawn, so does
the poet bearing the gift of homage serve and celebrate
you in song. And I, dedicated to you and celebrating
you, pray that we may be blest with knowledge strength
and energy and a long and happy life, bountiful and
generous as you are.

Ashvins Devata, Agastya Maitravaruni Rshi






Men of knowledge and wisdom, honour and
adore those teachers and scholars and rejoice with them
who give us this knowledge and create this mighty and
versatile chariot of ours which is fit for the Ashvins to
move at the speed of winds and light. They are the agents
of intellectual and scientific evolution, strong and
inviolable treasure-givers of health and wealth and
home, keepers of the light of heaven on earth, and firmly
committed to the paths of knowledge, action and
progress along the lines of purity and rectitude.






Ashvins, noble scholars, teachers and scientists,
you are the most honourable heroes, most powerful,
most dynamic and energetic, destroyers of poverty and
suffering, masters of will and action, creators of chariots
and the most daring pioneers of progress. You design,
create and drive the chariot that is perfect and laden
with the collection of the richest honey sweets of life.
And with that you come to the man of the chariot and
say: Take this, go round the worlds, and enjoy.




MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 182 811




Marvellous Ashvins, brilliant powers of light
and wisdom, generous preservers of life and destroyers
of suffering, what are you doing here? Why stay here
where anyone like nobody, miserly and selfish, non-
giving, non-sacrificing is honoured and flaunts as great?
Bypass the bargainer whose vision, judgement and
pranic vitality is draining. Give light to the noble holy
man in search of the holy Word and spiritual approval.




4. Jambhayatam-abhito rayatah suno hatam mrdho

Ashvins, crush all round those who bark like
dogs. Eliminate the wars and war mongers. You know
them. Richly fructify and reward every word of the

of celebration.






4. Yuvametam cakrathuh sindhusu plavam-atman-

Ashvins, scholar of science and technologist of
marine engineering and aeronautics, both create the safe

among the noble people, with your science and skill,
fly like birds and cross the wide seas.




6. Avaviddham taugryam-apsvantar-narambhane


Confined, surrounded and plunged in

MANDAL - 1 / SUKTA - 183 813


Ashvins, pilots of the sea and sky, what sort of
tree, post, is that standing in the midst of the deep sea
to which the powerful but afflicted marine team holds
on? What sailing and flying machine is that which like
the wings of a soaring bird you work up and down for
your honour and glory?






Ashvins, leaders of light ever committed to truth
and shunning untruth, whatever words of appreciation
and celebration venerable people have said in your
honour, may all that be auspicious to you, being true to
your character and performance. And may we today
from this yajnic hall of joy and bliss receive and carry
away food and energy to our heart’s desire, knowledge
and strength to live along the right path, and the breath
and life of the mind and spirit.

fragrance for your yajnic inputs, the chariot you ride is

your treasures of honey sweets of honour and glory.

every day constantly, praying for light and seeing in the
multiform and multicolour waters of the sky various
kinds of wealth like all kinds of wealth and nourishment
in the milk contained in the cow’s udders.






And let the cloud of the sky do us good. The
river flows for us like the mother’s milk for the baby.

Lord giver of food and nourishment, spirit
pervasive of health and energy, you are the giver of
divine joy to the generous powers of nature and the
generous nobilities of humanity. You are the giver of

tongued, a master of ancient as well as modern versions
of universal knowledge, whose delightful tales of
heroism old and new and virtue sacred and secular,
noble, intelligent and brilliant people love to hear for
reflection and meditation. Welcome and entertain such
a holy visitor on the rounds, an atithi, chance guest like
the holy fire of yajna, fragrant and blissful.






Words of meaning and power come to him at
his command and serve him according to the season of
time, place and the subject of discourse, Brhaspati as
he is, high-priest of the Divine Word. Like an extension
of the Lord’s creation, he makes divinities out of
dedicated humanity and brings them gifts of their choice.
Thus loved, graceful and powerful like the breeze of
life, he rises in the affairs of life and Dharma by the
grace of the Infinite Lord of the universe.

Let this Brhaspati, man of piety, knowledge. and

The voice of this Brhaspati and his fame goes

Supporter of the man of yajna, master of exceptional
knowledge and intelligence, let him continue to give
knowledge. And then, these voices of Brhaspati, like
the bounces of the deer, every day reach men of
generosity such as clouds of rain.






There are those rigid and sinful people who




accept the wise man as brilliant and good, but in reality
they exploit him to live by him for self-support as
parasites do. O Brhaspati, you yield not to the man of
crooked intelligence but choose the man of honest desire
for the gift of knowledge.




6. Supraituh suyavaso na pantha durniyantuh pari-


Brhaspati is like the guiding path of one who is
well-provided with food and energy and one who wants

He is like the all round loving friend of one caught up
on a difficult highway. Men who are free from sin and
every way look after us and who, with light and
knowledge, uncover the ignorance of those covered in






Just as the satellites go round Brhaspati, the
planet Jupiter, or as the flowing streams with whirlpools
reach the sea, so that scholar whom all the praises of

The poisonous as well as the slithering, and the
essentially poisonous as well as the slightly poisonous,
both bite and burn, and yet they both sprinkle and anoint
as antidotes too, and both smear, bite and burn unseen,
and they harbour the unseen.








One medicine immediately starts destroying the
poison as it is taken. Another destroys the poison while
its activity seems to be subsiding. Yet another destroys
it when its effect is extremely strong. And yet another
reduces and destroys it when it is completely






The parasitic seeds of poison lurk in the hollow
of bamboos and in inferior reeds, in the darbha grass
and in reeds and grasses round tanks, lakes and streams.
Unseen they lurk in the munja roots and leaves and
virina plants. Together they all stick to anything as
parasites.


4. Ni gavo gosthe asadan ni mrgaso aviksata.
Where the cows sit in the stalls or the forest
beasts sit or hide in their habitat or humans live in the


homes, and even in the brain and sense organs, the seeds
of poison lurk and cluster unseen.


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 191 847






unseen as they are and yet seen by all and known to all.
Therefore, all ye men and women, beware of them.




6. Dyaurvah pita prthivi mata somo bhrataditih


O seeds, parasites, insects and other carriers of
poison such as bacteria and viruses, the heaven of light
is your father, creator, the earth is your mother, feeder,
soma is your brother and nature’s fertility is your sister
(since both nectar and poison are born of the creative
power of nature). Unseen and yet universally seen and
known are you all. Why move, better be still for the
sake of good and comfort?






Those which creep or affect the shoulders, those
which move or fly and affect all parts of the body, those
which bite and burn, and those which are highly
poisonous and painful, all those which are unseen or
whatever, all together retire and exhaust yourselves of


the bite and the poison, be eliminated all.




8. Utpurastatsurya eti visvadrsto adrstaha. Adrsta-


There upfront rises the sun from the east,
universally seen and showing the world, and destroying
all that is unseen poisonous, eliminating all the
negativities and all that is evil and invisible to the naked
eye.




9. Udapaptadasau suryah puru visvani jurvan.

The sun rises there, lord of light, from behind

the mountains and the clouds, showing to the entire


world and destroying all the poisons on a large scale,
invisible evils which thrive in the dark.


10. Surye visama sajami drtim suravato grhe. So


Just as liquor is contained in the cask in the
house of a liquor maker, so do I collect the earth’s poison
and evaporate it to join the sun so that neither the sun


MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 191 849


would die nor would we, since the poison would join
the far away sun which would drink it up. O poison,
then the honey sweet chemistry of nature may turn you
to nectar honey.






O man infested with poison, this little
consume your poison. That bird would not die, nor
would we. The one that drinks up the poison unharmed
would keep it far off. O poison, the life’s chemistry of
nectar would turn you too to honey.



12. Trih sapta vispulingaka visasya puspamaksan.


Twenty one little birds eat up and consume the
flowers of poison. But they do not die for sure, nor
would we. The one who would consume poison
undisturbed would keep it far off. The honey-science
of nature would turn the poison to honey.






13. Navanam navatinam visasya ropusinam. Sarva-


Let me have the names of all the ninetynine
lacerations of poison and of all the ninetynine antidotes.
The man who can counter poison and calmly render it
or fear. O poison, the science of honey nectar would
turn you to honey and nectar.




14. Trih sapta mayuryah sapta svasaro agruvah.


May the twentyone peahens and seven sisterly
streams and rivers flowing on and on collect and carry
off the poison as female water carriers carry water in





This little poisonous insect that comes to me,
this little mongoose, that holds the poison, I strike with
a gem stone. The poison flows, and I collect and isolate
the poison from the area as an antidote.




MANDAL - 1 / <^ - 191 851


16. Kusumbhakas-tad-abravid gireh pravartam-
te visam.


The little mongoose coming down from the
mountains tells me that the taste of the scorpion’s poison
is dull. For this reason, on this expansive and practical
basis I say, the poison of the scorpion is tasteless.


Note: The mantras in this Sukta point to the
possibilities of isolating all poisons, bacteria and viruses
that cause disease. They also suggest the preparation of
antidotes from those very poisons, bacteria and viruses.
They also point out to the fact that in natural evolution
poison and nectar are coexistent carriers of death and
life. They are contradictory effects of the same one
since all contradictions in nature are apparent, but
essentially they are all complementary.


The term ‘Madhula’ is suggestive of this
chemical process in nature itself. Swami Dayanand
interprets it as the science of converting poison into
nectar for our purposes. Elsewhere as in Sayana or in
Kaushika Sutra or by Satavalekara it is interpreted as a
herb, which too is true. There is a herb on the hills, for
example, the touch of which bites as scorpion, giving a
burning poisonous sensation all over the body, for which
reason it is called the scorpion herb. And immediately
close to it is another herb the juice of which turns the


In fact every poison, it seems, carries its own
antidote which has to be isolated, analysed and




developed like all the vaccines in modern medicine and
all the drugs in homeopathic medicine. The dose of the
poison would depend upon the effect desired as in the
case of all stimulants, intoxicants and painkillers.


The myth of churning of the ocean by the Devas
and Asuras (gods and demons) is an all-time symbol of
the contradictions alias complementarities of nature,
whichever way you want to put it. It shows that both
nectar and poison are born of the ocean of nature and
the power that consumes and assimilates the poison for
the sake of the continuance of life and existence is Shiva,
lord of nature’s justice and ferocity on the one hand,
and lord of the saving grace of Divinity on the other.
The word for this power of turning contradiction into
complementarity, and turning the poison into honey-
sweet nectar in this Sukta is ‘Harishtha’. For references
to Madhu Vidya or the honey science of nectar we may
turn to Yajurveda and the Upanishads specially
Chhandogya Upanishad 3, 1-5, and Brhadaranyaka

of creation and development. They come to you as
brother with love and peace at heart for the sake of
friendship and fraternity as they see in you the glow of
health and grace of the body politic. You act as son of
the mother earth and her people as saviour from want
and suffering and protector against lawless bullies and

Divinity which reflects in the hundred years of the
scholar’s awareness. O lord of the world’s wealth of

who dispels all darkness and destroys ignorance.




12. Tvamagne subhrta uttamam vayastava sparhe

Agni, lord of the fire of life, knowledge and
vision, poet of nature, humanity and divinity, the

regard you as the very tongue of divine will and vision.
Liberal powers of fragrant favours and generosity seek

oblations offered into the fire.




14. Tve agne visve amrtaso adruha asa deva havira-


Agni, immortal spirit and vital power of life, by

15. Tvam tantsam ca prati casi majmana’ gne sujata


Agni, spirit of life in existence, light of the
world, brilliant, generous and universally manifestive,
by virtue of your power and grandeur, you are immanent
and yet transcendent. You are with all forms of existence
together and with each one of them separately, and yet
you are distinct and superior and rise above them all.
Whatever abundance of life and wealth is there, exists
here and prospers by virtue of your power and grandeur.
Even the heaven and earth and the intermediate regions

16. Ye stotrbhyo go agram-asvapesSasam-agne


Agni, lord of light and life, to the brave and

all, we pray, bring a peaceful and happy home for
settlement so that we all, blest with the courage and
knowledge of truth, sing in praise of your great gifts of
light and generosity in our yajnic programmes.


Mandala 2/Sukta 2
Agni Devata, Gritsamada Rshi




1. Yajnena vardhata jatavedasamagnim yajadhvam
dam.


By yajna, research and development, expand the
power and gifts of Agni, treasure of knowledge and
power. Ignited and shining, rich and beautiful, harbinger
of wealth and comfort, brilliant, generous giver of gifts,
energy and power, it moves the wheels of action on the
paths of progress. Develop it with holy inputs offered
with elaborate voices of vast and far-reaching meaning.


2. Abhi tva naktirusaso vavaSire’gne vatsam na




Agni, lord of light and power, master of
knowledge and fire, as cows in the stalls eagerly call
for their calves, so do the days and nights call upon you


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 2 863


for action and success. Selected by many, disciplined
and committed to programmes of work, you passionately
shine day and night for ages of humanity, creating and
giving wealth and power for progress.






That fire power of Agni, admirable among
humanity, worthy to be discovered and known as a
friend, mighty rich in quantity and quality of power,
bright and blazing with flames of light and waves of
energy, brilliant and generous scholars find abundantly
present in the depths of the earth and between earth and
heaven in the midst of clouds and in the lower
atmosphere, and they develop it and exploit it as a
chariot of speed and success for progress.




4. Tamuksamanam rajasti sva a dame candramiva
anu.


That energy of Agni, generous, creative and
abundant, falling from space profusely in particles in
waves of motion, concentrating in both heaven and earth
through the skies, the scholars with their organs of
perception, volition and intelligence collect like food




for the journey of progress and store it, dear and lovely
as gold, in the power homes of their own making and
use it in circular and wavy motion for the production of
power and vitality in simulation of both creative earth
and heaven.






That Agni, self-refulgent lord of light and life,
is the chief yajamana of universal yajna which He
conducts, governs and transcends. Him too the whole
humanity celebrates with songs of praise and they
augment His yajna with holy offerings in the vedi. And
He, voracious Agni, with a golden face and fiery mouth,
receives, devours, burns and blazes, radiating and
vibrating among the people advancing on their path of
progress. May the Lord collect and radiate the light and
vitality of life for us and spread it around by the shining
stars, and let us too simulate and conduct the yajna in
pursuance of heaven and earth.


So also let the performer of scientific yajna
conduct the holy project of research and development
of light, energy and vitality on a universal scale. Him
the people recognise, appreciate and applaud in words
of praise and gratitude with holy offerings of support.
Let this yajaka with a golden face radiate the light of
knowledge, and, as an illuminating power among the


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 2 865


people moving forward on the path of progress, let him
shine as stars, collecting, developing and creating new
light in pursuance of the generosity of heaven and earth
at our level.




6. Sa no revat samidhanah svastaye sandadasvan


Agni, such you are, shining bright, wealthy and
abundant, generous and giving, create and bestow the
light of knowledge and wealth of the world on us for
our good. Just as heaven and earth create light and
wealth and with it bless humanity, so you too create the
wealth of existence for the grace and glory of life on
earth and let the earth become a happy place fit for the
divinities to come and dwell.


(The mantra, according to Swami Dayanand, 1s
applicable to the brilliant saintly and generous scholars
and scientists.)





Agni, give us liberally. Give us the grace and
the glory a thousandfold. Reveal the light and, likewise,




open the flood-gates of knowledge, wealth and power,
and the velocity of light for the speed of progress. Let
the heaven and earth be the eastern horizon of a new
dawn and the dawns bring in brilliant days of holy light
and creative vitality of life’s purity.




8. Sa idhana usaso ramya anu svarna dideda-rusena

May the same Agni, bright and burning, radiate
and illuminate us day and night with holy light. And
may he, ruler of humanity, lovely and charming, high-
priest of life’s yajna of love and non-violence, ever on
the round like a beneficent visitor, with the rise of the
morning sun, with holy offerings as well as gifts of food,
energy and joy, add to the health, happiness and
longevity of the people.




9. Eva no agne amrtesu purvya dhispipaya brhad


Thus, Agni, ancient light of eternal vision,
knowledge and wisdom, we pray, increase and advance
for us among our people, immortal lovers and seekers
of universal knowledge, versatile intelligence for our
human purposes, and, with your sincere mind and soul,


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 2 867


impart a hundred fold specialist knowledge and
expertise of various forms in various fields to the expert
inventor, designer and worker according to the need
and requirement of the situation among our dynamic
people, knowledge and expertise from which may flow
the wealth of food and honeyed prosperity like abundant
milk of generous cow.




10.  Vayamagne arvata va suviryam brahmana va


Agni, leading light of life and humanity, let us
acquire noble strength and power with speed and
transport. Let us enlighten our people with knowledge
to a higher than usual degree. May our honour and
splendour be high over and among all the five classes
of people. Lord of light, purify, sanctify and brighten
our holy joy so that our strength, honour and happiness
becomes difficult to challenge and grows inviolable.



11. Sano bodhi sahasya prasamsyo yasmintsujata


Agni, adorable lord of life and majesty, leading
light of humanity, mighty commander of challenge and




victory, instruct and enlighten us in that struggle and
endeavour for life, living in which the bright and brave
aspire for success and arise nobly reborn and seasoned
leaders. Temper us in that yajnic ordeal of fire, eternal
and subtle, shining and burning in everyone’s own heart
and home, which the warlike heroes enter and attain
the life eternal.




12. Ubhaydso jatavedah syama te stotaro agne


Agni, Jataveda who know and govern all that is
born in the world of existence, bless us that we may be
both your admirers and worshippers and also shine
bright and brave in the household. Help us Lord, and
give us the competence to have a liberal share of your
gifts of happy home, health and wealth, all round peace
and divine grace, plenty and prosperity, a happy family
and bright children.



13. Ye stotrbhyo go-agram-asvapesasam-agne rati-


Those learned, bright and brave people who
create and offer gifts in homage specially of quality cows


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 3 869


and lands and handsome horses for the worshippers of
Agni and developers of the science of fire, O lord of
light and life, giver of peace and happy home, you
advance all these and us in life, and bless us that we
may, wise and brave, sing songs of praise to celebrate
you in yajnic acts of life.


Mandala 2/Sukta 3
Agni Devata, Gritsamada Rshi






Agni, light and fire of life and all existence, is
established in action on and in the earth. It abides in
and by all regions of the universe, each one of them,
directly, immediately and positively. It is the sacred fire
that carries on the yajna of the universe, giving,
receiving and giving again in the cycle of cosmic
dynamics. It is ‘pavaka’, refiner, purifier and sanctifier.
It is bright and blazing, innately intelligent, guiding and
directing the onward march of life.


May Agni, in its own right of its nature and
Dharma, bright and ever giving as the Divinity, abide
by all the divinities of nature and humanity, holy powers
all, and, together with them, carry on the cycle of life in






cally, in an open-ended applied manner in the human
context: Agni is the scholar, teacher, researcher, ruler,
producer, worker, in fact any power human or natural,
creatively working for life and helping humanity and
the environment for the progress of all living beings in
the service of God.)






Agni, lord of life and light of the world, adored
by many people, self-refulgent with the light of his own
flames, revealing the regions of the universe with his
own knowledge and power and lighting the threefold
fires of the sun in heaven, lightning in the sky and fire
on the earth, including the three fires of the home, i.e.,
garhapatya, ahavaniya and daksinagni, replete with ghrta
and brilliant with his own inner light of mind, receiving
the offerings into the vedi and augmenting and returning
them manifold in showers of bliss, may, we pray, bless
and beatify the brilliant and generous yajakas of divine
order seated at the head of yajna.

MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 3 871


Agni, praised, adored and celebrated lord of
light and power of knowledge, first and foremost friend
of humanity, worthy of honour and pleased to listen and
bless, we pray join the brilliant divinities and reward
them with science and sacred knowledge now as ever.
Lord, such as you are, bring us the speed and force of
the Maruts, mighty winds, and the imperishable power
and glory of Indra, showers of electric energy from the
clouds. Come ye all members of humanity, join and
honour Agni seated on the grass upfront on the holy
vedi of your yajna of life.




4. Deva barhirvardhamanam suviram stirnam raye

Deva Agni, brilliant and generous lord of light
and life, knowledge and bliss, come and grace this holy
grass spread around the vedi manned by bright and brave
young people and, with ghrta in the vedi, refine and
reinforce the waters full of virility, holding power and
prosperity and further expanding for the growth of life’s
wealth and joy. And let the Vasu order of researchers,
Aditya order of eminent scholars, all nobilities of the
world and holy yajakas, the vitality of the Vasu sources
and supports of life and the light of the sun on yearly
rounds, too, join the programme and vitalise the waters.






5. Vi Srayantamurviya huyamana dvaro devih


Let the sacred doors of yajnic progress, wide,
expansive and easy of access, open and welcome the
performers. And let the performers, youthful and

wide earth and spread around with acts of humility and
gratitude, purifying and sanctifying the integrity of their
form and character, honour and grace, and the heroism
of their young generation.




6. Sadhvapamsi sanata na uksite usasanakta


May the night and day going together in orbit,
singing in unison, replete with the waters of peace and
bliss, abundant in the milk of life and profusely giving,
harmoniously shaping and advancing the beauteous
form of nature’s vast yajnic evolution, like two
companion women weaving the warp and woof of cloth,
bless us with noble competence for holy yajnic actions
performed with humility and gratitude to Agni, lord of
light, yajna and advancement.


(Like the night and day the husband and wife
should act in unison and carry on the holy yajna of the
family and the household as part of the vast yajna of
life in existence.)


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 3 873




7. Daivya hotara prathama vidustara rju yaksatah


The two divine yajakas, day and night, husband
and wife, of prime nature and character, blest with innate
intelligence, and handsome in form and stature, carry
on the creative yajna sincerely and naturally with hymns
of praise for the lord of existence. Carrying on the yajna
in honour of the divinities of nature and nobilities of
humanity according to the seasons on the vedi of the
earth and over the three peaks of space, 1.e., the earth’s
atmosphere, the middle region and the region of
heavenly light, or doing their best in the first, second
and third quarter of life for Dharma, artha and kama,
they live and act together.




8. Sarasvati sadhayanti dhiyam na ila devi bharati


Ila, the transcendent Infinity of Divine
revealed, recorded and envisioned in meditation, and
Bharati, living human speech which holds the treasure

come and grace our holy seat of yajna and bless it as
our perfect haven and faultless home under protection
of the divinities.




9. Pisangarupah subharo vayodhah srusti viro


The person who loves God and serves the
divinities of nature and nobilities of humanity soon and
sure grows handsome in form and personal splendour,
generous and abundant in nature and habit, strong in
health, virility and longevity, and bright and brave in
performance. May Tvashta, lord creator and maker of
life-forms, give us progeny, our sustenance and security
for life, and then bless us with food and maintenance
for the learned and the divines on way to the holy
destination of life.




10. Vanaspatiravasrjannupa sthadagnirhavih


May Agni, ruler and life-giver, Vanaspati, giver
of vitality to vegetation, stand by us. May Vanaspati,
trees and all vegetation, giving fruits, flowers and life-
breath, stand by us. Agni, sun and fire, prepares for us


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 3 875


the food for life and yajna. So also may Agni, the scholar
specialist of the science of yajna, knowing his subject
and aware of his duty, rising high in the light of holiness,
divine of nature, creator and harbinger of peace, bring
in for us yajnic materials mixed, refined and sanctified
three ways by thought, word and deed for threefold
purpose of the health of body, mind and soul for the
divinities of nature and humanity.




11. Ghrtam mimikse ghrtamasya yonirghrte 5110


I mix, prepare and offer ghrta into the fire. Ghrta,
vitality, is the womb of fire energy. It (fire energy and
vitality) exists in fertility, ghrta, which is its medium.
And this ghrta, fertility, too abides in Ghrta, eternal
creativity, Agni, Life Supreme, which is the ultimate
abode of all existential energy, vitality, fertility,
production and procreation. O Vrsabha, youthful and
generous yajaka overflowing with the lustre and
splendour of vitality, bring in the sanctified and
dedicated materials committed to Svaha, the word of
truth and sincerity of the oblation in yajna. Collect,
prepare, commit, offer with faith and dedication, and
rejoice in your act of creation.




Mandala 2/Sukta 4
Agni Devata, Somahuti Bhargava Rshi




deva adeve jane jatavedah.


For you all, I invoke, adore and worship Agni,
lord of light and giver of life and energy, blissfully
shining, selflessly generous and abundant in food and
wealth of the world, ever on the round among the people
like a cherished guest of honour, who may, I pray, be
the sustainer and protector of all like a friend, brilliant
light giver for all the people who know and understand,
omnipotent as he is in the world of existence, lord
omniscient as he is of all that is born.




2. Imamam vidhanto apam sadhasthe dvita dadhur-


This fire energy, uniformly present in the midst
of waters in the womb of space, the Bhrgus, specialists
of heat energy, collect, bring down, reproduce, and place
the part available among the people for their use in two
forms, one that gives heat and light and the other that is
motive energy. May this agni, fire energy, dynamic and
strong, fastest in motion, be vastly and universally
available to all as gift of the divinities of nature’s power


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 4 877
and the brilliant scholars of the earth.






Agni, heat and light energy, brilliant scientists
living among human communities in the world produce
and establish like a dear favourite friend in power
homes. And that power, developed and exploited by
experts, as a catalytic force burning in waves of light,
brightens up the nights all round with love and joy for
the man of generosity.




4. Asya ranva svasyeva pustih samdrstirasya hiya-


Joyous and beautiful is the growth of this fire,
satisfying as one’s own. Delightful is the holy form of
it as it rises to a bright and blazing stature. Brilliant and
inspiring is it while it shines in herbs and trees, and
awful is its form while it raises its flames of fire like the
tongues of a voracious demon or shakes them like the
mane and tail of a chariot horse.








That immensity and golden glory of Agni which
the scholars and admirers fail to measure, comprehend
and express for me and the worshippers, He himself,
joyous and blissful, reveals directly by his glorious light
in meditation and through its majesty in blaze, the same
and again every moment of time.




6. A yo vana tatrsano na bhati varna patha rathyeva


Agni, bright as sun rays, flaming with light and
love, shines, radiates and roars like a flood rushing on
its way, or like a war horse on the highway. Bright and
burning, it goes on dispelling darkness and leaving a
trail of light on its path, blazing like the light of heaven
and thundering like lightning. It can be known and
realised with homage of service in humility and inputs
of fine foods in yajna.





That is Agni which stands by us all round, heats


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 4 879


and lights the earth, and freely at will goes forward like
the light of the eye or like a cow without the shepherd
— Agni, shining, blazing and cleansing, heating and
moving the particles of matter and energy, attracting,
propelling and dispelling, breaking up, universal
presence all knowing, as if tasting everything that exists.




8. Nu te purvasyavaso adhitau trttye vidathe manma


in studies and in our third and highest order of yajnic
ways of living you teach us the eternal science of all
round protection and progress. Bless us, O lord, with
bright and brave dedicated youth, immensely growing
prosperity of food, knowledge and speed of
advancement, noble progeny, and wealth, power and
honour.




9. Tvaya yatha grtsamadaso agne guha vanvanta


Agni, lord of light and life, for the wise and the
brave and for the teacher and the celebrant, bring that
health and age by which the people, happy and
enlightened, shining within with discriminative




intelligence, blest with noble youth and fighting force,
challenging hate and enmity, may, by your grace, rise
high and ever higher.


Mandala 2/Sukta 5
Agni Devata, Somahuti Bhargava Rshi






The yajaka, man of self, man of intelligence and
self-awareness performing yajna, giving and
cooperating with creative people, grows and is reborn
as father, supporter, sustainer and protector for the elder
generation and sustaining powers for the protection and
advancement of life and society in general as part of
the social and historical cycle, creating wealth, power
and services worthy to be attained. Let us too, intelligent
and progressive, be able to create an environment which
may take us forward as a disciplined and organised




vati.


In the cosmic conduct of the universal yajna,
the sun is the performer, and there are seven rays in the
spectrum of light acting like seven priests. There is one


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 5 881


more, eighth, just like the human agent in the socio-
natural yajnic life of the world, and that is the divine
sanctifier and sustainer who pervades and sustains the
entire world of existence.






He holds and controls the waters of life, and He
reveals the universal knowledge of existence, the Veda.
And He knows that world of existence and comprehends
the cosmic system and its working. Thus He holds and
controls its working just as the centre-hold of the wheel
and the rim hold the structure and control the movement
of the wheel.



4. Sakam hi Sucind Sucih prasasta kratundjani.


Surely he who, by the grace of the Divine Spirit

of universal purity, grows pure, and, by the divine
control and universal action of the Spirit of the universe,
rises to a state of self-control and right action, he is
reborn as the real man of knowledge, and, abiding by
the immutable law and discipline of Divinity and nature,
grows high and great in life like the branches of a tree
(drawing and receiving the spirit and breath of life from
the root at the centre of existence).








And those girls and women who abide by the
nature, law and self-willed action of the Omniscient
Controller of existence, and, like sister streams flowing
from the same source, receive abundant and cherished
showers of life and light energy from the three worlds
of earth, heaven and the middle regions of the skies,
rise to the beauty, grace and generosity of the divine
fire and waters and bless the world around like mother
cows by virtue of their knowledge, performance and
devotion.




6. Yadi maturupa svasa ghrtam bharantyasthita.


If the mother and the sister bearing ghrta and
water come and sit close around the vedi in yajna, then
on their arrival the high-priest and the yajakas rejoice
like herbs and grass and barley on the arrival of rain






Let the priests and yajakas do their priest-like


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 6 883


tasks for the sake of heavenly light and the self in the
service of Agni, lord sustainer and controller of life and
the universe. Let them offer songs of praise and yajnic
action to the Lord. May we too, we pray, as participants
of yajna, rejoice in the holiness and divinity of life and,
with dedicated performance, attain the abundant wealth
and waters of life and the spirit divine.




8. Yatha vidvan aram karad visvebhyo yajatebhyah.


O lord giver of light and life, Agni, what this
man of knowledge and wisdom does holily and
gracefully for all the saints and sagely performers of
yajna, the same he does for you too in dedication. And
so also whatever yajnic acts of life we perform, we
dedicate to you.


Mandala 2/Sukta 6
Agni Devata, Somahuti Bhargava Rshi






Agni, lord giver of light and knowledge, pray
accept this holy fuel of mine offered with folded hands,
accept this homage and allow the supplicants entry to
the yajna of enlightenment, and listen graciously to these
prayers of mine.








Agni, child as well as creator and preserver of
energy and power, lover of speed and acceleration,
brilliantly risen to eminence, with this offer and homage
and by this song and celebration of light and fire, let us
serve you and advance the yajnic development of
knowledge and energy.






Agni, lord of wealth and power of existence,
lover and creator of energy, power and wealth, giver of
wealth and honour, with songs of love and praise, we,
your lovers and devotees, are at your service with our
homage and holy offerings — seekers and supplicants
as we are.



4. Sa bodhi surirmaghava vasupate vasudavan.


Agni, lord of light, give us knowledge and
enlightenment. Lord bright and brave of knowledge,
power and honour, lord of wealth and grandeur, giver
of wealth, power, honour and glory of the world, ward


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 6 885


off all hate and jealousy of existence and cleanse us
from within.






Agni gives us the rain showers from the regions
of the sun and sky. Agni gives us the power and
automotive speed of movement without the horse. Agni
gives us a thousand forms of food and energy.




6. Ilanayavasyave yavistha dita no gira.


Agni, lord of light and power, youngest and
unaging, harbinger of safety and destroyer of evil, power
adorable and generous giver, for the supplicant and the
worshipper in need seeking protection and progress,
come and listen to our prayers.





Agni, omnipresent lord of light, you are ever
present in the heart within. Lord of knowledge, poetic
visionary of the universe, you know the birth and death
of things past, present and future. Harbinger and giver




of knowledge of life in existence, you are the friend of
all living beings for the sake of entire humanity.




8. Sa vidvan a ca piprayo yaksi cikitva anusak.


Agni, lord of knowledge, loving and kind, you
give whatever we need since you know and command
the wealth of the world. And, omnipresent in the quarters
of the universe, you come, manifest and bless our home,
sit on our vedi of yajna, this same one where we pray.


Mandala 2/Sukta 7
Agni Devata, Somahuti Bhargava Rshi






Agni, most youthful spirit and ruling power of
the world, Bharata, lord commander of abundance and
prosperity, home of life’s joy and comfort and giver of
whatever wealth whoever loves to have, come bearing
that best and highest and most shining wealth which
entire humanity loves and aspires to create and possess.
Come and bless all.




MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 7 887


2. Ma no aratirisata devasya martyasya ca.


Agni, generous and brilliant lord ruler of the
world of life, let no one who is selfish, ungenerous,
uncreative and graceless rule over us, whether we are
learned and bright or just simple ordinary folk living as
children of nature. Liberate us from him, purge us of
the hateful and the envious within and without, and
purge him too of hate and enmity.






Agni, lord of light and knowledge, brilliant
ruling power of the world, let us all, with you and by
your divine grace, plunge and penetrate into all forces
of hate and enmity, explore and fight and cross over the

13. Asmabhyam tad vaso danaya radhah samar-thay-


Indra, lord of light, power, honour and
generosity, giver of peace, progress and prosperity, great
and manifold is that wealth of yours which is your
parental gift to us as a home and haven to live in joy.
Give us the strength and capacity for charity and
that brave and blest with brave heroic progeny, honoured
and glorious, we may profusely praise and
spontaneously celebrate your wondrous and heavenly
gifts and glory day by day in song and yajna and justify
your gifts of life and honour to humanity.


Mandala 2/Sukta 14
Indra Devata, Grtsamada Rshi






High priest of the yajna of love and non-violent
creation, bear potfuls of soma juice for Indra, brave and
youthful hero of the world. Collect and serve exciting
food and drink for him in celebration. Eminent, valiant
and victorious is he and loves a drink of this soma.


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 14 921


Always call for and prepare the drink for the mighty
hero. He loves to live the vigour and ecstasy of life,
create the strength and rise in joy.






High priests of the yajna of life, just as a stroke
of lightning breaks and shatters a tree into bits, so does
Indra, solar hero of the world, break the dark cloud
concealing and hoarding the waters of life and thereby
releases the showers of rain and joy of life. For him,
bear and bring this soma of joy and celebration. He loves
it intensely, and this Indra deserves to drink of it to his






Yajnic leaders of the people, Indra, lord ruler of
humanity and the world, is he who, like the brilliant
sun, dispels the forces of fear and darkness, develops
the cows and animal wealth, preserves and replenishes
the earth and her environment, opens up flood-gates of
power and energy for you and, like the wind in the sky,
drives life onward. Carry on this yajna and the creation
of soma-joy and vigour for him, celebrate him like the




wind in the sky, felicitate him with drinks of soma and
honour him with robes of distinction as you would
honour a veteran hero and senior scholar of eminence.




4. Adhvaryayo ya uranam jaghana nava cakhvan-


High priests and participants of the progressive
yajna of love and creative advancement, invoke, applaud
and advance Indra, leader and commander of humanity,
who exposes and punishes the hoarder, eliminates the
saboteur, overthrows nine and ninety handed demons,
and binds and chains down hundred millions of enemy
forces. Honour him and celebrate with oblations of love
and offer of soma for the creation of vigour and life’s




5. Adhvaryayo yah svasnam jaghana yah susnama-


High priests of yajna, invoke, invite, honour and
offer homage with food and love to Indra who breaks
through the clouds of ignorance, who prevents the
thriving social suckers and converts deserts into fertile
fields, who breaks the shoulders of lawless powers, who
fights and defeats the self-server and the persistent evil


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 14 923


doer, and who brings to book those who cross the bounds
of preventive law. Do him honour in the yajna of love
and dedication.




6. Adhvaryayo yah satam Sambarasya puro


High priests of yajna, offer soma yajna to Indra
who shatters with a lightning stone blow a hundred well-
established strongholds of the demon of darkness who
arrests and prevents the joyous waters of life from their
natural flow, Indra who digs out and uproots a hundred
thousand sins and crimes of the blazing powers of evil
and buries them for ever. Regale him with a drink of
soma, the universal joy of life.






High priests of yajna, bring soma drinks
in honour of Indra who sows the seeds and creates a
hundred thousand heroes of yajna on the face of the
earth, while on the other hand he destroys another
hundred thousand warriors of evil and wards off the
forces of the opponents of generosity and hospitality.






8. Adhvaryavo yannarah kamayadhve srusti vahanto


High priests of yajna, faithful performers,
leaders of humanity, whatever you love and desire,
whatever you achieve and attain, always with a will in
obedience to Divinity carry that forward and hold it in
the service of Indra, lord ruler of the world, and bear
and bring it up soma, purified and sanctified by the rays
of the sun, as an offering in homage to him who is
universally heard, praised and celebrated. Enjoy the bliss
and ecstasy of soma with him.




9. Adhvaryavah kartana srustimasmai vane niputam


Leaders and participants of the yajnic
developments of humanity, do your best willingly and
spontaneously for this mighty and brilliant Indra. Do
that and let it be sanctified and consecrated in the light
and purity of the sun and raise the social order in the
holy light. Join Indra and do his will, whatever he loves
and desires of your art and industry. And when you have
accomplished that with the expertise of your hand and
imagination, then invoke, invite and honour him and
celebrate the exciting pleasure and ecstasy of the soma


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 14 925


of success.




10. Adhvaryavah payasodharyatha goh somebhirim


High priests of the yajna of white revolution
and herbal essences, let the streams of soma flow for
health and joy and surfeit Indra, the mighty order of
humanity. Let the order overflow with food and drink
like the cow’s udders with milk. I know him and the
wealth he holds for me. Join him, let everyone know
and serve him for his creation and generosity, and let
all carry on the effort in unison.




11. Adhvaryavo yo divyasya vasvo yah parthivasya


High priests of yajnic action and advancement,
citizens of the world, serve Indra who is ruler of the
light of heaven, the wealth of earth and the sweets of
love and tolerance. Fill his kingdom to overflowing as
farmers fill the stores with food and drink. Let the life
on earth sparkle with streams of soma and shine with

divine dedication. Let that be the dynamics of human






12. Asmabhyam tad vaso danaya radhah samartha-


Indra, lord ruler and master of the wealth of the
universe, bless us with that wealth and honour, light
and power, and strengthen us that we may be generous,

various is your wealth of life. May we, O lord, blest
with that honour, power and splendour, brave and rising
with the brave, every day and night sing of your glory
and justify your gifts of yajna in our actions and


Mandala 2/Sukta 15
Indra Devata, Grtsamada Rshi




1. Pra gha nvasya mahato mahani satya satyasya


I would set forth and sing in celebration of the
great and true actions and achievements of this great
and eternal lord Indra, ruler of the world, brilliant and
blazing as the sun who drinks up the distilled essences
of earth, heaven and the middle regions in three ways
and radiates and matures exhilarating soma in three
orders of nature, herbs of the earth, waters of the sky


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 15 927


and light of the solar regions, and who, in the power
and ecstasy of this soma process, strikes and breaks the
dark cloud of showers for rain on the earth.




2. Avamse dyamastabhayad brhantama rodasi


Indra, lord of existence, sustains the mighty
heaven of light in space without a supporting column.
He fills the heaven and earth and the skies of the middle
regions with light and fertility for life and holds the
earth in orbit. And thus the lord manifests his power
and glory in the expansive universe across the spaces.
In the ecstasy and Ananda of the soma of creation, the
lord performs all these actions for life and humanity.






Like a sacred house of prayer, Indra, lord creator,
makes the worlds of existence since eternity with exact
measures and perfect knowledge of their form, function
and purpose. He splits open the upsurge of waters from
river sources, digs the beds of flow with a natural and
spontaneous stroke of the thunderbolt and releases the
floods by paths deep and wide for us to move and




navigate. Indra does all these in joy and ecstasy for his
love of creation and for the soma pleasure of his




4. Sa pravolhrn parigatya dabhiter-visvam-adhag-


Having overcome all the weapons of violence,
fear and terror, he burns them in the blazing fire of his
cosmic yajna and creates modes of transport and
communication with bullocks, horses, chariots and
waves of energy and motive power. He does all these in
his ecstasy of creativity for the joy of his creation. This
is the glory of Indra.


CHITIN




He gives motion to the waters, and the earth, in
fact to all things on the move, and he controls, stabilizes,
arrests and ultimately stills that movement to rest. He
helps the uninitiates to move and cross the seas for their
good, and they rise and, having bathed in the waters,
abide in the wealth of divine bliss. Indra does all these
in the ecstasy of creation for the joy of his creation.


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 15 929




6. Sodancam sindhum-arinan-mahitva vajrenana


With his blazing might he reaches and raises
the rising sea. With his light he adorns the chariot of
the dawn. Moving and shaking the motionless with his
own forces of velocity, Indra goes on with his actions
in the joy of his creation for the joy of his children.






He, self-refulgent lord of knowledge, removing
the veil of darkness from the lights, manifests himself
and stays high and above all. Listening to the prayerful,
he abides by all, reveals himself and speaks to the
faithful. Thus does Indra perform his actions of divinity
in his own ecstasy of creation and for the created.




8. Bhinad valam-angirobhir-grnano vi parvatasya


Indra, blazing ruler of the world, proclaiming




his power and presence, dispels the dark and distressive
forces of life with the rays of his light and knowledge.
He breaks open the deep caverns of mountains and the
clouds and opens their gates for sun and shower. He
shatters the artificial walls of division in humanity for
their progress. These are the acts of Indra done in his
ecstasy of soma for his people.




2. Svapnenabhyupya cumurim dhunim ca jaghantha


He alerts the man yawning with sleepy sloth,
silences the agitator, destroys the robber, suppresses the
fearful devil, and, under his rule, the honest worker gets
his wages in gold. Such are the acts of performance
which Indra accomplishes in the ecstasy of soma for
the joy of the people.

10. Nunam sa te prati varam jaritre duhtyadindra


Indra, lord ruler of the world, giver of light and
joy, may that magnificent generosity of yours award the
highest fulfilment to the celebrant, and cherished
knowledge to the worshipper. Lord of power and


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 16 931


splendour, may your glory shine and blaze for us but
not burn our gifts of your magnanimity. And may we,
brave and blest with the brave, celebrate your glory in
our yajnic acts of piety and obedience to your will.


Mandala 2/Sukta 16
Indra Devata, Grtsamada Rshi






O worshippers and dedicated devotees of Indra,
for your sake I offer the sweetest song of celebration in
honour of the highest lord of life and energy as _ I bear
and offer oblations of holy fragrant havish into the
lighted fire of yajna. We invoke and serve Indra, unaging
lord of imperishable energy, full of inexhaustible power
and eternally youthful, consuming and converting matter
into energy. We develop the lord’s energy for our
protection and advancement.




2. Yasmadindrad brhatah kim canemrte visvanya-


Without this great lord Indra, eternal power and
energy, there is nothing that is great, indeed anything at




all. In this supreme presence are held all the courage,
valour and virility. In his oceanic potential lies all the
power, peace and pleasure. In his body, he holds
challenge, patience and fortitude, grandeur and
splendour, in his hand, thunder and lightning, in his
head, vision, intelligence and noblest yajnic action.






Not by heaven and earth is your wealth and
chariot be exhausted and out-distanced by the expansive
seas and high mountains or even by the spatial clouds.
Nor can any weapon even remotely approach the
invincible terror of your thunderbolt. All this because
you shoot like an arrow with the tempestuous rays of
light and waves of energy and currents of winds many
many miles and yojans distance instantly.



4. Visve hyasmai yajataya dhrsnave kratum bharanti


All bear noble thoughts and perform holy acts
of yajna in honour of this lord Indra, cosmic yajamana,


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 16 933


bold and daring, overwhelming and generous, and
universal friend and constant companion. Generous
yajaka, you are very wise and highly knowledgeable.
Offer yajna with homage and fragrant havis. O lord
Indra, participate in our yajna alongwith the generous
sun and like the sun, drink the soma of joy and grant us
the bliss.






Treasure clouds of liquid energy explode from
the sun and radiate all round, honey streams of light
and power flow from the sun, in waves, for the
nourishment and maturation of the vibrant life in
existence as food and drink for the mighty humanity
and other living beings. Roaring clouds rain down living
waters for the health and joy of the children of earth.
Generous high-priests of the yajna of love and non-
violence press out soma and distil the exciting drink of
life and ecstasy from the herbs and raise it in flaming
waves of fragrance.






6. Vrsa te vajra uta te vrsa ratho vrsana hari vrsa-


Indra, generous and potent lord of life and joy,
mighty is your thunderbolt, tempestuous your chariot,
fast as winds are your horses, and blazing are your arms
and weapons of justice, reward and punishment.
Generous and mighty lord, you create and govern the
infinite treasures of life, vigour and joy. O lord of power
and energy, drink of this invigorating soma of joy and
give us too the drink of it to the depth of surfeit and
heights of sobriety.






Loud and bold in inspiration for the challenges
of the business of living, with all my wealth of power
and prayer I come to you, lord of light and knowledge,
and take on to you as to a boat in the struggle for survival
and success across the seas, eloquent as you are with
the Word of the Veda and light of Divinity. Indra, lord
of knowledge, listen to this word of prayer, know what
we need and desire. We come to you, associate with
you, serve you, and study and develop divine energy
and power with you as a treasure-house of the wealth
of the world.


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 16 935




8. Pura sambadhadabhya vavrtsva no dhenurna


Indra, lord of a hundred noble acts of yajna, by
virtue of our ancient and eternal relation as father and
son, mother and child, creator and creature, pervader
and pervaded, teacher and disciple, come to us like the
abundant mother cow overflowing with the milk of life
for her darling calf on the pasture, and be with us always,
never forsake us, lord, so that we too, with all noble
thoughts and intentions, reach you and ever be with you
like generous, loving and prayerful men abiding in the
company of intelligent and life-sustaining wives and






Indra, lord giver of light and the wealth of life,
may that magnificent bounty of yours flow and shower
the desired excellence upon your singer and celebrant,
sure, instantly and incessantly. May the light of
knowledge and wealth of power given to the devotee
ever shine for us but never blaze to excess, never burn,
so that, bright and brave, blest with the brave, we may




sing in praise and homage to you in our yajnic acts of
life and the music may rise and ring across the spaces.


Mandala 2/Sukta 17
Indra Devata, Grtsamada Rshi






Offer homage of praise in worship to this
adorable lord Indra, light of the world, like the breath
of life, since his powers operate in life as of old and
eternally and who in his ecstasy of soma-yaga of
creation, with a stroke of his omnipotence, opened forth
and activated all the clouds of dark energies which lay
asleep all round during the night of the universe.






May that Indra, lord creator, be good and kind
to us, Indra who first for the creation and sustenance of
the universe manifests his creative energy in Prakrti and
then expands his own power and potential across the


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 17 937


world of nature. Mighty is he who in the battlesome-
interaction of the elements creates the grand structure
of the universe and then, as the pervasive spirit of life,
veils himself in the body of the universe. It is he who,
by his own essential might raised the heaven of light on
high and stayed it there.






And thereafter, first of all, he creates the prime
universal fertility and creative vitality, mighty energy
forces, which he with his omnipotence and omniscience,
sets in motion. They, great lokas and regions of the
universe, released and accelerated by Indra, master of
the chariot as well as of the horses, roll and revolve and
rotate youthfully, all together and separately too, each
by itself.

4. Adha yo visva bhunabhi majmanesanakrt pravaya


Indra, lord creator, who is master controller and
ruler of the worlds of the universe by his omnipotence,




pervades the expansive universe, and, wielding and
sustaining the creation, fills the heaven and earth with
light and, binding and integrating the far off regions
togehter, dispels the darkness from the regions and
covers them with the light of divinity.






He strengthens and firms up the ancient high
clouds with his might and splendour and creates the
lower ones this side of time and also creates the waters
of the middle regions of the skies. He wields and sustains
the earth mother of all the living life and holds and
sustains with his marvellous power the heaven of light
above, steady, secure, and extensive.




6. Sasma aram bahubhyam yam pitakrnod visva-


That is for this: The sun which the father creator
has created and fashioned forth in beauty with his own
hands over all that is born and all that know, that mighty
catalytic power by which he breaks and burns the atoms
and, with a stroke of thunder and lightning, melts the


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 17 939


cloud in rain showers to flow on earth and rest in the
oceans. That sun is for this lord Indra and his pleasure.
And the sun is for this darling Indra of the world of
creation, the human soul which the father creator has
fashioned forth in body and adorned with his own hands
and which is over and above all that is born, by virtue
of its knowledge and intelligence. And this darling child
too, this humanity, is for the sun and earth and for the
father creator to be ever in service for preservation of
the earth and environment and for dedication to Divinity.






Like a dedicated maiden abiding in the father’s
home I pray: Le me rise from this physical house of life
to the glory of divinity. Indra, lord of light and
knowledge, raise me to knowledge. O Sun, bring me to
light and lustre month by month. Bless me with the best
that is mine, my share of life, by which I may rise to the
highest that I can be, my own real self.




8. Bhojam tvamindra vayam huvema dadistvamin-


Indra, bountiful lord of the beauty and joy of




life, we invoke you and pray: Lord of wealth, honour
and power, give us the strength and courage to do our
karma. Give us the light of your knowledge and vision.
Lord destroyer of hate, jealousy and enmity, save us,
protect us with your wondrous ways of protection. Lord
of generosity, make us profusely rich and generous with
the gifts of life.







Indra, lord of light and knowledge, power and
glory, may that munificent generosity of yours, and may
that knowledge and divine teaching of yours bring unto
the singer celebrant and the disciples holy gifts of their
heart’s desire for sure and at the earliest. Give us the
strength and vision that we, brave and blest with the
brave, be great celebrants of your glory in our holy and
yajnic acts of life in your service. Let the light shine, let
the fire blaze, but not burn any of the gifts of Divinity.

MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 18 941


Let the latest new chariot be harnessed this

propellers, manmade chariot for humanity, self-
generative for power which may be navigable with

2. Sasma aram prathamam sa dvittyamuto trttyam


That chariot is perfectly suitable and
comfortable for this lord Indra, creator and ruler of
power. Harbinger of knowledge, comfort and power for
humanity, it covers the first stage of the earth, second
stage of the sky, and the third stage of space. The product
of one is taken over by others who move it further so
that, victorious and highly productive, it joins with the






In this versatile chariot of Indra, lord of power

Indra, lord of power and honour, listen well to
our song of praise and prayer. Take to the chariot, yoke
the circuitous motive energies to the chariot pole and
come post haste to receive our homage and yajna
fragrance. Be responsive to the invocation and invitation
of many, O generous lord, join in this auspicious
celebration and rejoice with us.




8. Na ma indrena sakhyam vi yosadasmabhyama-

Never may my love and friendship with Indra
be snapped, and may his kindness and generosity ever
keep it flowing for us abundantly. And may we, closely
under his high protection and divine light, be inspired
for victory in every project of life at the very start of the
expedition.








Indra, generous lord of wealth and power,
honour and victory, may that magnificent generosity and
kindness of your grace ever flow abundantly for us and
bestow upon the singer celebrant and the disciples sure
gifts of their favourite choice. And may your teaching
and knowledge and your grandeur ever shine for the
admirers but never burn the love, desire and self-
confidence of the devotees. And may we, brave and blest
with the brave, ever celebrate your heavenly glory in
our noblest yajnic projects of life.


Mandala 2/Sukta 19
Indra Devata, Grtsamada Rshi






Ye saints and sages all, masters of mind and
thought, lovers of Divinity and leaders of humanity, you
have tasted of the food and drunk deep of the honey
sweets of nectar for the beauty and ecstasy of life at
that fount of light divine where Indra, the Sun, ever
abiding, rising and waxing, holds his place in the light
of heaven! O for a draught of that nectar, a morsel of
that food, a glimpse of that light!


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 19 945




2. Asya mandano madhvo vajrahasto’himindro


Tasting of the nectar sweets of this divinity in
ecstasy, Indra, the Sun, armed with light and thunder,
breaks open the clouds of darkness holding floods and
oceans of water, and thence flow, flying like birds of
life, bright days of light and sparkling streams of water.





That great Indra, lord omnipotent, activates the
waters in the midst of space and he, breaker of darkness
into light and life, then creates the oceans. He creates
the solar system, reveals the stars, planets and satellites,
shows the days by nights and directs the daily round of



4. So apratini manave purunindro dasad dasuse






The same omnipotent lord Indra who breaks the
clouds of darkness bestows on the generous man of
noble thought and meditation many gifts of
immeasurable value. May the lord ever be friends with
people who struggle forward in life for sun and shower
of the light and peace of Divinity.






That Indra, lord of universal energy, light and
wealth, brilliant and generous, releases for the creative
man of research and development the light and power
of the sun in addition to songs of praise and appreciation
and, bringing unknown and indescribable wealth for
this man, never destroys the share that is his due.




6. Sa randhayat sadivah sarathaye Susnam-asusam


Indra, lord of light and energy of the sun in
heaven, for the good of the guide and leader of humanity
and for the man of piety, charity and dedication to
Divinity, breaks the intensity of drought and the
pestilence of good harvest, overcomes ninety and nine
defensive walls of the dark cloud for rain and converts
drought into showers and famine into plenty and fertility.


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 19 947


Thus the lord accomplishes the purposes of Divinity
for humanity.






Thus we, O lord Indra, on our way to Divinity
by our mind and soul with speed and sincerity, may, we
pray, hear the word of your glory and have a glimpse of
your admirable action. And may we, acting and thus
struggling, cross that seven stage path to Divinity
whereby we may eliminate from within and without the
words and weapons of the impious reviler and destroyer
of faith and reach our destination.




8. Eva te grtsamadah §ura manmavasyavo na


O lord of light and divine action, thus do your
admirers and celebrants in ecstasy, like children seeking
protection of the parent, sing in praise of your thought
and marvellous actions. And thus may they, praying and
working for the gifts of Divinity, attain the blessings of
your eternal and ever new food and energy, peaceable
haven and home, and joy and comfort in the shade of

for the disciples but never burn off their love and desire
and the prosperity of us all. And may we, brave and
blest with the brave, celebrate your glory in our holy


Mandala 2/Sukta 20
Indra Devata, Grtsamada Rshi






Indra, lord of life and ruler of the world, please
to know us well. Like a fast driver, accelerating his car
to the destination, we bear our homage of yajnic food
and songs of praise to you. We come, lord, admirers,
shining, with sincerity of mind and heart, joining and
praying to powers human and divine as to you we come




for peace of mind and all round comfort.




2. Tvam na indra tvabhiruti tvayato abhistipasi


Indra, lord of love, power and protection, you
are our own, protector of the life and interests of our
people who are yours, you are committed to us with all
your means of protection and advancement. You are the
mighty lord and master, saviour and promoter of the
man of charity and of anyone who approaches you
sincerely in faith that you are the real and ultimate master
and saviour.






Indra, lord of life, ever young, generous giver
invoked and invited, our friend, giver of peace and bliss,
may he be the guardian and protector of the people.
May he guide and enlighten the admirer, zealous
worshipper, self-developing devotee and the singer






4. Tamu stusa indram tam grnise yasmin pura


O man, I worship that lord Indra, celebrate, in
song, him in whose protective shade humanity has
grown and advanced since eternity and fought out the
evil and the wicked. He, reaching out to the lover of
wealth, fulfils his desire and blesses the new initiate in
search of Vedic knowledge and spiritual enlightenment.






That same Indra, lord of light and power,
delighting in the admirable wealth and knowledge of
the people, watching and loving the wide earth, taking
over the beauty of the dawn with the splendour of the
sun, and silencing the roar of clouds, augments and
advances the songs of the celebrants since eternity and
releases them from their bonds.


6. Sa ha sruta indro nama deva urdhvo bhuvan-




Indra, omnipotent lord of light and generosity,
is surely the supreme power heard and celebrated in the
Revelation, self-refulgent giver, highest above all, who

is the ultimate saviour and destroyer of suffering for
humanity. Dear and loving to anyone who approaches
him, bold and patient and tolerant, highest on top of the
world of existence, commanding absolute power and
sustenance, he brings total joy and fulfilment to his
servant and supplicant.






Such is Indra, breaker of the clouds of rain
showers. He opens up the wombs of energies, dark and
deep, to let out the floods of existence into positive paths
of generation, creating the earth mother and the waters
of life for humanity. He is breaker of the walls of
hoarders’ cities to release the flow of wealth in human
history. May the lord raise the honour and wealth of the
host of yajna by virtue, truth and creative generosity.




8. Tasmai tavasyamanu dayi satrendraya devebhir-


To that omnipotent Indra, in the battles of
creation for the waters of life and generation of the
wealth of existence, mighty offerings are made into the

of nature and the noblest of humanity who hold on to




their part in obedience and response to this wielder of
the thunderbolt in arms who destroys the evil and the
negatives to overcome the cities of gold and steel in

Indra Devata, Grtsamada Rshi






The great and powerful sun drinks up the soma,
essence of vital juices reinforced with herbal elixir,
matured in three containers, 1.e., the earth, the sky and
the heaven of light, and distilled by light and wind while
it shines and energises the essences.


He who delights in energising this sun, greatest
of the great in nature, to do great things, who blesses

light and energy.






The mighty universal energy with its own
electric force and its action fills up the heaven and earth
with universal water vapours full like a reservoir, and it
continues to grow by the omnipotence of the
omnipresent lord Indra, the self-refulgent Indra. It holds

others. (Aditya-like should the teachers be.)

complementing each other like two halves of a sphere

Adityas, powers of light and law, dedicated to
yajnic advancement of life and nature, whatever your
bonds of power and law, sinless and inviolable, spread
across the earth, which are like chains of arrest and
prisons of punishment for the lawless and the enemies
of humanity, let me, I pray, cross them over with ease
and pleasure by the chariot of knowledge and action
like a knight of horse, so that we may live at peace in
bliss on this vast earth, common home of the human

Varuna, lord of justice, highest and best of our


choice, I pray I may attain to the progress and prosperity
of a dear and generous man of wealth and dignity, but




not to the swelling pride of a man of easy money.
Brilliant lord ruler of the nation, may I never be deprived
of wealth well-earned with honesty. And let us all, blest
with noble progeny, speak well and highly in thanks
and praise of the lord ruler of the world in all our yajnic

1. Idam kaveradityasya svarajo visvani santya-


This is the song of honour for Aditya, self-
refulgent lord of light eternal and poetic vision of
omniscience who, with his might, rules over and
transcends all forms of existence and karma. Lord of
brilliance and generosity is he, extremely kind and
pleased with the liberal man of yajna. I pray for a vision
of the glory of Varuna, magnificent lord of abundance,
love and justice and crave for his mercy and pleasure.






Varuna, lord of knowledge and wisdom, law and


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 28 989


blest with good fortune and all round prosperity and,
singing in praise and admiration of Divinity, be rewarded
with noble intelligence and scientific knowledge of
existence. And when the dawns arise with their wealth
of light rays and the cows stir in their stalls, let us, like
holy fires of yajna, celebrate the glory of the morning






Varuna, great leader of humanity, universally
admired and followed by hosts of brave warriors, let us
live in peace and bliss under your protection as in our
heaven and home. And ye, all our children, be brilliant
and generous, inviolable and indomitable, be strong and
brilliant as children of eternity and prepare yourselves
for action and cooperation in the service of the Lord.




4. Pra simadityo asrjad vidhartan rtam sindhavo


Aditya, the sun, sustainer of the regions of the
world, creates the waters all round and then the streams
of Varuna, the cloud, shower down and flow. They tire
not, nor ever stop. Like flying birds they flow all round
on the earth at their top speed.








Like the chain of slavery, loosen the hold of sin
and evil from me. O Varuna, lord of law and justice, let
us prosper and promote the stream of virtuous living in
your service. While I weave the web of my life, snap
not the bond of nature and intelligence with my mother.
Snap not my bond of karma before the time is ripe.




6. Apo su myaksa varuna bhiyasam mat samralr-


Varuna, lord of love and justice, keep off fear

MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 28 991


Varuna, lord of life and giver of pranic energy,

who commit sin against your yajnic law. Let us not go
astray from light to the dens of darkness. For our life
and holy living reduce and eliminate the forces of hate
and violence.




8. Namah pura te varunota nunamutaparam tuvijata


Lord unassailable and ever powerful of all, we
raise our voice of homage and offer words of salutation
to you in the past, at present and in the future. O Varuna,
as herbs grow on the mountain and vapours rest in the
cloud, so peace and comfort rest in you, and in you abide
the imperishable laws of existence and inviolable rules
of life’s discipline and conduct.





Varuna, lord of light and law, acquit me of the
highest liabilities, and obligations undertaken by me.
Never let me live on the fruits of others’ labour. And in
the many days of light not yet come, in which you would
be there to protect us, teach us, all the living souls, to


live the way we should.




10. Yo me rajan yujyo va sakha va svapne bhayam


Varuna, lord of light and law, brilliant ruler, if a
friend or companion threatens me with fear and I feel
afraid in a state of sleep or wakefulness, or if a thief or
a wolfish robber terrorizes us, save us from such fear
and terror.




11. Maham maghono varuno priyasya bhuridavna a

I may never suffer the empty pride and morbid swelling
from the wealth of a dear, prosperous, generous man of

O Vasus, shelter homes of life and humanity,
teachers and scholars generous as mother earth, what
shall we do for you with our share of karma and

what is dear to you at heart. Protect us against the violent
wolf and the greedy robber. Worshipful and dedicated
to yajna as you are, save us from evil time and violence.








Varuna, lord of light, law and justice, let me
never come to that state of sufferance when a dear,
mighty generous man of honour and power either suffers
from empty pride of easy achievement or suffers want
and penury. O brilliant ruler and law-giver of the world,
let me never suffer the want of well earned wealth of
money and materials. And let us all, blest with noble
children and followers, sing in praise of the Lord for
his gracious gifts of righteous prosperity.

Devata, Grtsamada Rshi






The streams of the existential flow of divine
action stop not, nor do they play for fun, for the creator
of waters and the executor of laws, self-refulgent Savita,
the sun who inspires Prakrti with life, nor for Indra who
breaks the clouds for rain. The light of his actions
radiates continuously day by day. When did the first
flow of these actions of creation originate? (Let us

The one (sun) who for the cloud of darkness
bears the food (of vapours) as well as the bond (of
structure and formation), of him the mother Nature
speaks to the man of knowledge. And in accordance
with the will divine the streams of light and action flow
to their destined goal carving out their paths of motion
day by day.






The sun abides high up in heaven far above the
middle region of the sky. And then it bears, raises and
strikes the deadly weapon of the thunderbolt upon the
cloud and, taking the vapours on all round, it melts the
waters to rain. Thus it is that Indra, sunny wielder of
the lightning weapon, who conquers the adversary, the
dark and deep cloud of rain.




4. Brhaspate tapusasneva vidhya vrkadvaraso




Indra, destroyer of enemies, Brhaspati, lord
sustainer of the vast world, just as with your mighty
blazing thunderous weapon you broke through the front
gates of the stronghold of the cloud and destroyed the
forces of the demon of darkness and drought earlier, so
now destroy our enemy (and throw open the gates of
light and prosperity).






Indra, lord of light and power, ruler of the world,
admirable, joyous and fiery, hurl the thunderbolt from
high up regions of light and destroy the enemy, the same
thunderbolt by which you struck and broke the cloud,
and for the progress and prosperity of our children and
grand children and for the growth and development of
our land and cows, grant us plenty of means and

create a social order free and fearless, full of joy.




7. Na ma tamanna sramannota tandranna vocama


Indra, who gives me fulfilment, who gives me
wealth and happiness, who gives me enlightenment, and
who blesses me with the gift of cows and health of mind
and senses, while I offer homage to the lord, may, I
pray, never vex me, nor tire me, nor make me feel
languid with lassitude. And may we never (with
ingratitude) say: “Do not offer homage of soma to the

the surreptitious foe in hiding and the saboteur who

with weapons of offence and defence, and surround and
seal the force of the jealous and the destructive along
with their counterparts.






O Indra, valiant hero and ruler of the world, with
our resolute heroes of real mettle, do the deeds worthy
of your character and majesty. And if there be
adversaries long puffed up with pride and arrogance,
break them down to their reality and hold and manage
their assets and ours for the nation.

accelerate our project of the chariot.






And those two refulgent and generous divinities,
dawn and night, twins in mutual sight, which inspire
the moving and non-moving worlds of being, I praise,

of life for us. And I, Ribhuksha, in search of intelligence,
strength and knowledge, with all effort of intellect and
passion in holy action, growing fast and faster, receive
the food for body, mind and soul.






These acts and higher gifts of yours, O powers

association, I crave and pray for, which men of desire
in search of knowledge and fame, progress and

progress in knowledge, power and piety, O man of

Those Rudras, stormy winds and roaring clouds,


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 34 1021

security and good fortune, since they are ever fresh,
dynamic and ever on the move like a wheel in constant
motion.




15. Yaya radhram parayathatyanho yaya nido


O Maruts, pioneering guides of humanity, divine




powers of knowledge and holy intelligence, that virtuous
mind and power of protection by which you save the

maligners, may that power of protection, that noble
intelligence, like a loving mother, come hither to me

Mandala 2/Sukta 35
Apam-napat Devata, Grtsamada Rshi






Close to the waters in search of food, energy,
vitality and fast speed of action, I create this song related
to water energy and subsequent water wealth. May these
holy words of mine, loud and bold, flowing like a stream,
be delightful and bear fruit and fulfilment. May that
divine energy born of waters, instant and imperishable,
be in accord with the holy voice and help us create many
beautiful forms of life and various wealth for us.




2. Imam svasmai hrda a sutastam mantram vocema


Let us chant this mantra conscientiously created


MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 35 1023


and composed from depths of the heart in honour and
celebration of this magnificent power. May the great
lord of the wide world know of it. Indeed this mighty
energy born of the waters, replete with wealth and
power, with the great omnipotence of divine nature,
creates the entire worlds of existence.






Some of these streams of water and currents of
energy flow together. Some others flow close by them,
and all of them together join and flow into the ocean to
fullness. And these clear and purest streams of water
and water energy all round abide by that pure, bright
and blazing child of the waters, imperishable agni, fire
and electric energy of the water power. (This mantra
describes the dynamic circuit flow of energy and its
imperishable form in the state of conservation.)


4. Tamasmera yuvatayo yuvanam marmrjyamanah
Just as young maidens in crystalline purity of


body and mind and fragrant modesty anxiously yet
bashfully approach the youthful man, feeding his fire




and receiving the shower of life and love, so do
crystalline streams of water murmuring with exciting
energy approach from all round that Apam-napat, fiery
energy of the essence of waters, and he, overflowing
with vitalising energy, fertilises their thirst for life and
creativity. May that, the eternal elan vital distilled from
waters by nature, bright and blazing like flames of fire
fed with ghrta in yajna, shine on by itself in the waters
of life for us.






For this Apam-napat, liquid and fiery energy of
waters, brilliant, generous and inviolable divinity, three
brilliant and generous streams of dynamic energy, Ila,
Sarasvati, Mahi, eternal, universal and specific forms
of divine energy, flow and bear food for his sustenance
and growth. They move like young maidens
approaching their man for the continuance of life and
vital energy. They move on and on like three divinities,
reflections of the divine will in the cosmic oceans of
time and space, and he, the fiery creative energy, drinks
the milk of life from the three motherly powers.

short of ripeness in nature. Nothing false, opposed or

for the sake of the generous man of charity, wields power
and prosperity, and shines with might and majesty.




8. Yo apsva $Sucina daivyena rtavdjasra urviya


Abiding in the holy waters of nature’s liquid


bounty, dedicated to nature’s law and blest with her
consecrating power, vast and constant with the earth,

are like the branches of his family tree where, too,
further, grow the trees with their own farther branches.




9. Apam napada hyasthadupastham jihmanamur-


Apam-napat, essential energy born of the waters

We serve this Apam-napat, golden energy, with
yajnas and feed it with food and sacrifices in the midst
of many powers of nature for the good of our closest
friends. I refine it in the vedi, sustain it by degrees with
fuel, feed it with food and sacrifices and celebrate it
with exalting songs of Rks.



13. Saimvrsdajanayat tasu garbham sa im Sisurdha-


That potent and generous Apam-napat, vital heat
of life, creates the fetus in the waters. The same baby




sucks the same vitality of the waters. The same water
energies then kiss and caress the baby. The same, then,
in bright, unfaded effulgence shines in the youthful body
as it shines in other body forms too.






Mighty streams of cosmic energy, with their own
imperishable velocity, flow all round bearing ghrta and
anna-food for their grand child, Apam-napat, abiding
all-time effulgent in this highest state of existence.




15. Ayamsamagne_ suksitim janayayamsamu


Agni, vital spirit of life in existence, I pray, may
I attain a blessed home for the people. May I receive a
glorious hymn of divine worship for our people of power
and honour from our poets of power and imagination.

protect and promote. And may we, blest with the brave,

Savita Devata, Grtsamada Rshi






That self-refulgent lord Savita, creator and
inspirer of the universe, omnipotent lord of action, holds,
rules and sustains the universe and abides supreme over
the eternal Prakrti. Indeed, he alone wields, orders and
sustains the magnificent universe for the sake of living
beings and carries on the sacred yajna of creation for


the well-being of all.






For the good of the world alone the generous
and self-refulgent lord Savita of long and mighty arms
abides over all and extends his rays of light across the
spaces. The waters too, pure and purifying, flow within
his rule of law, and so do the winds play around every
where under the same law.






Savita, lord of light, the Sun, with its radiant
rays releases the moving planets from the shadow of
another planet as it removes the shadow of darkness
and causes the planet to shine. And for the sake of
protection it also controls the movement of the winds
coming to the clouds as also other serpentine movements
either freakish or destructive. Thus the night and release
from darkness comes according to the rule and
movement of the Sun’s light, and that is the divine law.

of the brilliant and generous lord Savita, creator and
ruler of the world.






O lord creator and ruler of existence, by you is

MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 38 1039

according to their state of karma, and the same lord as

and deserved by the soul the moment its eye is closed
on death. Thus do all living beings under the sun come
back to their ultimate home from where they had gone

justice of Savita, Supreme Lord Creator: Neither Indra,
the sun and cosmic electric force, nor Varuna, the waters,
nor Mitra, the winds, nor Aryama, life breath of air, nor
even Rudra, the soul by itself or in alliance with any
power of nature, no enemies, that is, any imaginable

our success in the achievement of the wealth of life we
may ever be blest with His love and grace.




11. Asmabhyam tad divo adbhyah prthivyastvaya

by you from the regions of light and the enlightened
people, from the waters and the generous people, from

Mandala 2/Sukta 42
Indra (in metaphor) Devata, Grtsamada Rshi





Speaking loud and bold, addressing humanity,
you take the Word forward like a mariner who takes his
vessel forward on the waters. O master of the Word,
flying like the eagle, you are the harbinger of good
fortune. No superior force from any quarter whatsoever
would approach you to disturb your mission.

2. Ma tva Ssyena uda vadhinma suparno ma tva


May none like the hawk smite you, nor like the
vulture violate you. Nor must the hunter with the bow
shoot you down with the arrow. Reverberating with your
voice loud and bold across the lands of your forefathers,
harbinger of good fortune, speak to us here of the good
things to come.






Speak aloud, proclaim from the house tops on
the right the good things to come. Speak of good fortune,
man of power and the Word as you are. May no thief
rule over us, no sinner, no maligner boss over us. And
we would all, blest with the brave, sing aloud in praise
of you and celebrant.


Mandala 2/Sukta 43
Indra (in metaphor) Devata, Grtsamada Rshi






1. Pradaksinidabhi grnanti karavo vayo vadanta


Going round clockwise from left to right in
obeisance, poets and artists sing in homage to Indra,
lord of light and power. So do birds of beauty and
majesty sing in praise of the lord according to the
seasons. So does Indra, poet of power, like a Soma-
singer chant the Word of both material and spiritual
significance as he chants and reveals the significance
of other mantras in Gayatri, Tristubh and other metres.



2. Udgateva sakune sama gayasi brahmaputra iva


Shakuni, poet of power and homage to Indra,
like the Sama-singer in yajna, you sing the songs of
ecstasy. Like the disciple of a Vedic scholar Brahamana,
you sing in homage to the lord in holy rites. Like a virile
and passionate bull approaching youthful females, speak
to us with enthusiasm of all round good things. All
round, speak to us of noble and blissful things.




MANDAL - 2 / SUKTA - 43 1057




Shakuni, poet of power and imagination, while
speaking, speak to us of good. Silent and sitting,
enlighten our mind with noble thoughts. While flying
on the wings of imagination, you speak of the way you
do good. Let us then, blest with good and brave children,
sing songs of high praise for the lord.

MANDALA 3


Mandala 3/Sukta 1
Agni Devata, Gathina Vishvamitra Rshi






Agni, brilliant scholar and fiery leader, you
speak to me of the strength and power of soma, the elixir
of life. You have prepared me, like the fire that carries
the fragrance of yajna from the vedi over earth and skies,
to join and conduct the yajnic business of life and play
my part in the battles of progress. Shining forth, I join
the brilliant best of generous humanity and, as fire
moves the cloud to break into showers, we move the
nation to release its potential into showers of peace and
prosperity. O leading spirit of life and humanity, Agni,
protect, promote and sustain the body politic of the
world community and move it forward.






Joining all together, we carry the yajna forward.


MANDAL - 3 / SUKTA - 1 1059


Let the voices of celebration and joy of the people rise
to the skies. Feeding the fire with fuel and fragrance,
doing homage to the lord of light with salutations in
dedication they conduct and control the yajna of social
order by virtue of the vision and wisdom of the sages
and the grace of Divinity. And they seek the highways
of further advancement for the sake of safety, security
and the joy of peace and enlightenment.






Agni, the yajnic power, as also the man of clear
vision, essentially pure and dedicated to yajna, by nature
a friend and brother of heaven and earth, holds the
treasure of comfort and joy. Brilliant and generous souls
and the divine powers of nature discover this golden
power, Agni, at the heart of currents of waters and
vapours, in the flow of pranic energies, and in the sister
streams of sparkling water flowing free, and the yajnics
find it in their own karma and in the waters.


4. Avardhayantsubhagam sapta yahvih svetam


Seven flames of fire as seven streams of water
with power and grandeur raise and elevate this glorious




effulgence emerging red and white in majesty. While
this Agni arises assuming a wondrous form, high-priests
of brilliance and generous ambition rush to develop and






Overspreading the vast spaces with beams of
blazing heat and light, raising and sanctifying the holy
programmes of yajnic development by poets and priests
and visionary experts of purest mind and heart, clothed
in purity and majesty, Agni as the brilliant yajaka goes
round and round creating and showering great
unbounded gifts of health, age and prosperity on all
across the flow of life in the world of nature.

Agni, light of the universe, takes to and abides
in the subtle unconsuming, pure unhurt streams, close
together, open yet not exposed, flowing unbroken from
the Light Divine. These seven streams of light and
speech flow here, constant, ever young, together and
they hold but one eternal meaning like a fetus in their


MANDAL - 3 / SUKTA - 1 1061


(The mantra applies to light and Vak, Speech,
flowing in seven streams of the spectrum.)






Expansive yet covered, united yet universal and
various are the gifts of this Agni abiding in the womb
of the waters of life and abounding in the flow of the
honey sweets of existence. The heaven and earth both
one and together are the manifestive mothers of this
lord of bliss and power.




8. Babhranah suno sahaso vyadyaud dadhanah


Agni, child of omnipotence, growing in power
and generosity, bearing and wearing beautiful forms of
versatility by virtue of passion and purity and the zeal
of light and lustre you are ever expanding and advancing
with equipoise. Wherever the honey streams of light
and waters of life shower and flow, there the potent man
of generosity grows in might and moves forward by the
poetry of divinity created by poets of vision and
imagination.


O Man, child of Manu, you too watch, follow




and grow by the poetry of power and purity created by
the poets of vision and imagination in honour of Agni.




9. Pituscidudharjanusa viveda vyasya dhara asrjad


Agni, light and vitality of life, knows the
creator’s gift of life and life’s home by its very nature
from the very birth, and that home is the cloud, the
mother’s womb, the night’s darkness and the mother’s
breast from where the streams of water, milk, speech
and intelligence immediately flow. This Agni, living and
growing in the cave of life, the mother’s womb, moving
with its blessed companions and with the streams of
energy flowing from heaven, doesn’t remain hidden in
the cave. One who knows life moving as such knows
the secret of life. One who doesn’t doesn’t.



10. Pitusca garbham janitusca babhre purvireko

Agni, spirit and vitality of life, nurses the one
life-embryo of both father and mother, and the one


receives nourishment from the mother as well as from
other universal sources of nature, abundant and swelling


MANDAL - 3 / SUKTA - 1 1063


all since time immemorial. Heaven and earth, father and
mother, both bound by nature to life in the embryo, bear,
nurse and support it to continue. O Agni, lord of life,
light of the world, protect and support both, father and
mother, heaven and earth, for the sake of this virile and
sacred humanity, for the continuance of this holy life,
this sacred humanity in the embryo.






Agni, mighty spirit and vitality of life, grows in
the lap of nature, vast and irresistible creative power of
Divinity, where the streams of ancient waters flowing
together feed it to bloom, expand and continue. Agni,
the fire of life, lies in the womb of nature and her cosmic
laws of evolution, assertive and inviolable yet subject
to the laws, a darling of the karmic flow of the twin
powers of heaven and earth, father and mother of the
baby in the process of procreation.



12. Akro na babhrih samithe mahinam didrkseyah


Agni, like an unbreakable wall of a fort is the




commander and defender of his mighty forces in the
battles of life. Auspicious and blissful of sight he is self-

his children. Creator of the rays of light and knowledge,
born of the womb of the currents of primordial energy,
it manifests as the great sun and most human leader of




13. Apam garbham darsatamosadhinam vana jajana


The vital fire and light energy abiding in the
waters and pranic vitality creates the woods of herbs
and trees, and the clusters of wood such as arani generate
this fire which is beautiful to see, full of wealth and
power and versatile in form. Scholars of heat and light
energy, conscientiously with their heart and soul, study
it practically and comprehensively. It is highly valuable,
manifest everywhere and a tremendous source of power.


14. Brhanta id bhanavo bharjikamagnim sacanta




Resplendent rays of light as dazzling flashes of
lightning serve and derive their power from Agni, simple
and natural refulgent power. They milk the nectar of


MANDAL - 3 / SUKTA - 1 1065


immortal light energy in the midst of vast spaces of earth

soul draws its light and joy from the Supreme Soul
immanent in the cave of the heart in the individual body

Jataveda, Agni, immanent and omnipresent in
every particle of creation, is constantly and eternally

Like refined and fortified ghrta offered in yajna
to the fire of the vedi, we generate, refine and sharpen
our courage and intelligence and compose hymns of
praise in honour of Vaishvanara Agni, fiery ruler of the
world and protector and promoter of the universal yajna

version of the chariot and the thunderbolt and surrender
it to Agni, divine high priest of the universal yajna of
creation as a hymn of tribute and celebration.








That Agni, Vaishvanara, fiery life of the world,

generate and develop Agni, heat and light energy, with

space. Let mother earth be blest with noble children of

Mandala 3/Sukta 5
Agni Devata, Vishvamitra Gathina Rshi





Just as Agni, fire divine, light of the dawn,
awakes, arises and awakens every morning, so does the
man of knowledge, dynamic scholar, attaining to the
positions of the men of light and vision, rise high and
higher day by day and awaken the sleeping humanity.




Agni, mighty powerful, lighted and raised in the
vedi by lovers of divinity, throws open the doors of light
against darkness. So does the scholar, bearer and
harbinger of the light of knowledge, dispel the darkness
of ignorance and reveal the light of knowledge to a
nation in slumber.






Just as the adorable Agni grows in heat, light
and power by the chant of songs and celebration of the
devotees and then this harbinger of light adorns the
morning with the bright and beautiful light of the dawn,
so does the sagely scholar, dedicated to the light of
eternal truth, shine in the lovely light of Revelation as
the messenger of light and life divine for the people.





Agni, heat and light of life, concentration of the
power of action, born of the waters of space and currents
of cosmic energy, friendly saviour, leader and guide to
success by the laws of Truth and flow of the will to
live, is established in the heart of human communities.
Bright and beautiful, loved and adored, it abides on top


MANDAL - 3 / SUKTA - 5 1089

the dynamic leader worthy of homage and reverence
for all intelligent people.




4. Mitro agnirbhavati yat samiddho mitro hota


Agni rises as a friend when it is lighted and
raised. As a yajaka conducting the yajna of evolution
and development it is a friend. As the omniscient lord
of existence and as presiding power of justice it is a
friend. As the highpriest of the yajna of love and non-
violence it is a friend, and as the power of inspiration
and self-control it is a friend. And it is a friend as it
flows with the rivers and rolls with the oceans. And
finally it is a friend as it sits on top of mountains and




Agni protects the friend and favourite, it protects
the amplitude of the earth in orbit, and the flight of birds.


Mighty powerful, it protects the rainbow colours of light
in space and the orbit of the sun in the galaxy. Noble,




elevated and sublime, it protects the pleasure and
amusement of the noble people who are brilliant and
generous.




6. Rbhuscakra idyam caru nama visvani devo


Mighty and versatile lord of light, omnipresent
in all facts, motions and laws of the universe, Agni
creates the soothing and adorable fluents such as speech
and waters, and guards them all wholly, without
reservation, and without let up. And whether it is
manifest or latent it shines charming in form like the
liquid flow of water or the rising flames of ghrta from the
vedi.






Loving and brilliant Agni, as the eminent
scholar, blazing pure and radiating fire, abides in the
seat since birth itself, overflowing with ghrta and
celestial waters, worthy of extensive songs of praise
and celebration, loving and glorious, and constantly,
again and again, renews, refreshes and reinforces its
generators, loving parents, earth and sky.

As soon as Agni is born, it is borne and grows,
in, with, and by, the herbs which, like nursing mothers,
increase it and themselves grow bright and green with
the waters and sunrays flowing down. Thus does Agni,
flowing like streams of life’s vitality, grow and evolve
in the lap of its parents, earth and sky, the mother and
the father, and thus does it preserve, protect and continue
the onward flow of life.






Agni, mighty spirit of life, raised, praised and
worshipped with holy food shines over heaven and earth
raining in showers from heaven on the vedi of mother
earth. Friend and saviour, adorable Agni breathes in and
collects the vitality of life from nature’s currents of
energy and, as the very messenger of Divinity, brings
the light and virtues of nature’s bounties for the lover
and performer of yajna.






10. Udastambhit samidha nakamrsvo’ gnirbhava-

scholars of science, art and technology. It abides in the
heart of every soul and in the centre of every particle of
matter and every wave of energy. I pray I may also light
this power that brings all the fragrant bounties of life to

work of creation and development, inspired by the voice

the earth, the seven flames of fire with tongues of gold




would speak for you in words loud and bold ringing
across the spaces.






When the human communities in pursuit of the
service and bounties of nature and the divinities of
heaven and earth, worship Agni, pure, powerful and

well being and the joy of life, to homes wherein and

Agni, omnipresent lord of knowledge and life’s
vitality, co-eval with existence, three are your lives:
magnetic energy and fire on earth, electric energy and
wind in the skies, and light in the solar region. You are
the vital heat of the body, will, passion and thought of
the mind, and vision and imagination of the soul. Three
are your motherly seats of existence and operation: earth,
sky and heaven of the cosmos, and the body, mind and
soul of the individual. And three are the times of your
operation: day and light, night and cold, and twilights
of the morning and evening. With these orders of three,

Mandala 3/Sukta 19
Agni Devata, Gathi Kaushika Rshi




visvavidam-amuram. Sa no yaksad devatata


In this yajna of creation and development I chose
to elect Agni as the highpriest and guide yajaka, adoring
worshipper, revolutionary thinker, eminent scholar, and
wise, who, while organising the yajna, would invoke
the brilliancies of humanity and bounties of nature and,
for the seeker of wealth and knowledge, create and
provide the wealth and prosperity desired.




ratinim ghrtacim. Pradaksinid devatatim-uranah


Agni, lord and highpriest of yajna, I come
forward to you in peace and faith and raise the holy
ladle full of fragrant havi, rich and splendid, overflowing
with ghrta, just as a faithful performer, extending divine
service to expand nature’s bounties, takes to yajna going
round the fire with excellent liberal offerings.








Lord of light, Agni, happy is the person that
loves you, comes to you with a brilliant mind thirsting
for knowledge and protection. Master of knowledge,
impart the knowledge as to your own dear child. Lord
of wealth, leader of the best people, may we live happy
and prosperous, worshipfully under your kind




4. Bhurini hi tve dadhire antka’ gne devasya yajyavo

Agni, lord of light, many are the flames of fire
which devout celebrants have raised in the vedi, many
the fighting forces which dedicated followers have
youthful, bear and bring that divine beneficence of
protection and security for which today you call and
conduct a yajnic team of scholars in pursuit of a noble
force and power of defence.



6. Yat tva hotaramanajan miyedhe nisadayanto


Devas, noble people, consecrate you in your


MANDAL - 3 / SUKTA - 20 1139


rightful seat for the conduct of yajna and celebrate you
as the highpriest and chief performer. So you, Agni, lord
of light and knowledge, leader of the people, guide and
protector, lead us to light and awakening, and bless us
and our descendants with food, energy and channels of
progress for our body, mind and soul.


Mandala 3/Sukta 20
Agni, Vishvedeva Devata, Gathi Kaushika Rshi




1. Agnimusasamasvina dadhikram vyustisu havate


In the lights of the morning, Vayu, cosmic
energy that holds the universe, calls up and awakens
the fire of Agni, light of the dawn, the Ashvins,
complementary currents of solar and lunar energy, and
the gravitational force with songs of the morning hymns
vibrating in spaces. So does the highpriest, conductor
of morning yajna, invoke and serve Agni, divine fire,
the lights of the dawn, pranic energies and the earth’s
gravitation with hymns of the Veda. May the Devas,
bounties of nature and brilliancies of humanity, all of
holy light and knowledge, loving and shining the yajna,
listen to our prayers.








Agni, divine energy of the cosmos, three are
your media: radiation, conduction and gravitation; three
your seats: solar region, middle region and the earthly
region (dyu loka, antariksha loka and prthivi loka); three
your tongues: light, thunder and greenery; O power
eternal, risen from the cosmic law of Rtam. Three are
your forms: day, lightning and night, energised by
nature; and three your sacred fuels: solar particles of
energy, vapours and fertility of the earth. Agni, divine
fire, protect and nourish our tongue and speech seriously


Note: The allegory of cosmic fire energy is
beautifully explained in Chhandogya Upanishad 5, 4-
8, and in Brhadaranyaka Upanishad 6, 9-13.


Swami Dayananda also interprets Agni as the
sagely scholar whose three media of existence are jnana,
gamana and prapti, i.e., knowledge, expression and
movement, and attainment and acquisition. We might
add in the same vein that his three seats of origin are
the parental home of natural birth, the teacher’s home
of educational and cultural birth and the family home
of professional birth. Of course, after retirement his life
is lived in an open social and universal home of no
dimensions and no boundaries.




MANDAL - 3 / SUKTA - 20 1141




Agni, lord immanent manifest in all that is born
in existence, generous and divine power, brilliant spirit
of knowledge and enlightenment, possessing nectar
foods and energies of life, immortal soul, countless are
your names and attributes. O lord omnipresent in the
universe, giver of the karmic dispensation of jivatmas,
whatever the generations of living beings old or new,
whatever the power and potential of these generations,
all that is vested and neatly nestled in you.




4. Agnirneta bhaga iva ksitinam daivinam deva


Agni is the leader and mover, like the sun, of
the living beings and the planets such as the earth and
other regions of the universe. He is the lord of all divine
powers and forms of existence. He is the ordainer and
sustainer of the cycle of the seasons, and the creator,
controller and sustainer of the laws of nature, truth and
rectitude. He is the destroyer of darkness, ignorance and
evil and eternal omniscient lord of existence. May the
lord purge the celebrant worshipper of all the dirt of
thought and action of the material world.








I invoke, celebrate and pray to Agni, divine spirit
and energy which, like Time, transcends all stars and
planets of the universe, brilliant dawn, Brhaspati,
sustaining wind energy, Savita, creator and light giver
of the universe, Deva, self-refulgent lord of love and
might, Ashvins, complementary currents of life’s energy,
Mitra and Varuna, prana and udana energy, Bhaga, lord
of wealth and honour, Vasus, abodes of life such as earth,
Rudras, vital energies of life, Adityas, moving stars of
light in orbit. I invoke, celebrate and pray to the Lord
for the light, wealth and honour of the world.

us.

the skies and spaces grow far and farther, that splendour
and glory is the blazing sun, the deep ocean and the
light of the eye for humanity.






Agni, you move and magnificently pervade the
particles of the light of heaven. You rise and do honour
to the divinely pious and benevolent people and the
generous powers of nature. And you pervade and

sun and those oceans which are below in the sky.

eternal energy of existence.

to revolve and for the Divine Speech to flow in the

Mandala 3/Sukta 31


Indra Devata, Vishvamitra Gathina or Kushika
Aishirathi Rshi






Let the scholar dedicated to the cosmic law of
solar radiation approach and study the morning rays of
the sun, grand children of the sun, being children of the
dawn which is the sun’s daughter, and let him study the
light and communicate the knowledge to his disciples
— even to control and apply the light in practical use.
And just as a father clothes and beautifies his grand
child, the daughter’s baby, and feels happy and proud
at heart, so would the scholar augment the beauty and
power of sun rays born of the sun, converting darkness
into day light, and feel happy and proud.







The son does not set apart the patrimony for the
son-in-law, he prepares the sister and accomplishes her
with education, culture and presents for his wife, the
mother of his children. The parents give birth to children,


MANDAL - 3 / SUKTA - 31 1183


son and daughter, one for the filial rites and duties for
themselves and family, the other as beneficiary of the
sanctities and accomplishments.






Agni arises in flames of fire fed with the ladle
of ghrta in the service of the sun in order to press forward
the children, 1.6., rays of the sun. Great is the offspring,
1.e., the day, of this great power born of the refulgence
of the rays, and great is the movement of the sun by
virtue of the cosmic yajna.




4. Abhi jaitrirasacanta sprdhanam mahi jyotista-


Victorious Maruts, currents of cosmic energy,
join and serve the sun, fighting the forces of darkness,
thereby manifesting the mighty light rising out of the
night’s darkness. Similarly, manifesting the sun rise, they
serve the dawns in consequence. And Indra, lord self-
refulgent, the sun, is the generator of the dawns and the
rays of light which bring about the day.








When the seven faculties of the mind and senses
grow too strong and rigid in their natural carnality, then
saints and sages of patience and courage, knowledge
and wisdom, calling up their original strength of the
spirit, control their senses, mind and intellect and
recover their vision of the path to universal truth and
the Divine Law. And the soul, with homage and humility,
enters the cave of the heart and discovers the light of
Indra, lord of the universe.




6. Vidad yadi sarama rugnamadrermahi pathah


O lady of dynamic thought and action, assessor
of the fast moving things of life, if you know the great
but broken path of the mountain and have it repaired at

showers, if you realise the noble voice of the ancients’
words of divinity and lead it forward, you would be the
first in knowledge and advancement.

rain for the people of yajnic action. Let the man, himself
desirous of yajna, share life and action with the youth
and, always loving and respecting others, be one with
them like the life-blood flowing in the nation’s veins.




8. Satah satah pratimanam purobhurvisva veda

nation, first among all, who knows the models, equals
and adversaries existing from moment to moment, who

Mandala 3/Sukta 33
Nadis, Streams, Devata, Vishvamitra Gathina Rshi






From the lap of mountains, arising brilliant and
passionate like the dawn, laughing and sparkling, and
bolting like a horse and mare, like two beautiful mother
cows yearning to meet their calves, two streams, one
expansive and divided (vipat), the other deep and
concentrated, fast and overflowing the banks (shutudri),
flow in unison rapidly to meet the sea with their water.


Note: Swami Dayananda interprets this mantra
as a metaphor of two brilliant women teachers issuing
forth from a mighty source of learning and going to
meet their disciples. He does not accept the
interpretation that Vipat and Shutudri refer to two
particular streams of these names. He does not accept
the historical comparative method of Vedic
interpretation which says that these mantras were
composed on the banks of Vipat and Shutudri streams.
On the contrary, he says that the words of the Veda
above.


Why these names in the Veda then? That’s the


MANDAL - 3 / SUKTA - 33 1201


question. Swamiji says that words of the Veda are
independent of history and geography. Particulars names
in history such as Rama, Krishna, and others, for
example, and names in geography such as Vipat and
Shutudri and Ganga were taken from the Veda and not
vice versa. There is no history nor geography of persons
and places in the Veda. All such words, which appear to

of science which are structured and interpreted

rain, sharing and receiving the impulse to grow, you
flow with crystalline waters, like beautiful chariot mares,
towards the sea. Meeting and growing together with
rising waves, feeding the environs, brilliant and graceful,
each of you meets and augments the other.


(The metaphor of learned women, meeting,
cooperating and beautifying the life around with
education and the graces of culture continues to apply.)








I go to the river, I go to the sea, dearest mother
generator and receiver of the rivers.


We go to the river, free, wide and auspicious.


The streams flow to the sea like mother cows
hastening to the stalls to meet the calf, loving and
caressing, reaching together in equal love and joy living
together in one home.




4. Ena vayam payasa pinvamana anu yonim deva-


We rivers rising with water and fertilizing the
land move on by the same course appointed by the divine
maker, never relenting in the flow, our birth itself and
flow is never meant to stop.


(The mantra refers to the stream of life,
continuance of the race, the family and the tradition of
education and culture.)






MANDAL - 3 / SUKTA - 33 1203


Bide a while, listen, pray consider and enjoy
my word of peace, prayer and beauty. Relax, why rush

the river and the sea from the core of my heart and mind,

existence and the soul’s cry for a moment’s vision of
constancy against the flux of mutability.)

so do the performers of yajna, men of generous hands,
joining the scholars of oceanic depth of learning, distil
the soma vitalities of nature and, with hands full of
fragrant offerings, sanctify the honey sweets of life with
streams of pure and holy showers of piety for honour
and glory.




8. Hrada iva kuksayah somadhanah samim vivyaca


Like lakes and mountain valleys are the
generous treasure holds of the bearers of soma. Many
are the yajnic processes of the creation and
reinforcement of the soma nectars. Indra, lord of




knowledge and brilliance, when he creates the first foods
and nourishments for life and tastes and approves of
these, then he, breaker of the clouds, selects soma as
the first and most invigorating power.




9. A tu bhara makiretat pari sthad vidma hi tva


Indra, lord of light and life, bear and bring us
the soma, fill our treasures, fulfil us wholly. Let no one
withhold it from us. We know you are the creator and

In the battles of forces in plans and programmes
of development for prosperity and excellence, in the
contests of forces positive and negative for good and
evil, in the onslaughts of stormy troops of hostility, in

sharpen your intelligence, and, thinking and




contemplating the farthest favourite places of space,

chariot. Such men of intelligence and poets of wisdom
I wish to see, intelligent as I am by the grace of Indra.






O seeker of knowledge and light divine, ask
these men of vision and wisdom about the life and birth
of the poets who possess a treasure of knowledge in
their mind, do great noble deeds, create knowledge and
fashion it forth in heavenly words. And then, may these
favourite vibrations of your mind, rising and elevating
you, explore and pursue the paths of higher knowledge
and Dharma of the universal order.






Bearing vibrations of the mysterious in their
mind here itself in the world, going over the spaces
between heaven and earth for the cosmic order, they

operations of the imagination, go over and within the
earth, and traverse the joining firmament and space

Indra, first and eternal lord, supreme, generous
and omnipotent, creates these forms of existence. These
ancient forms of this world are life-inspired and life-

with their will and action from the light of heaven hold
and sustain the divine yajnic order of nature and
humanity and promote the light of knowledge.

O brilliant powers of divinity, Indra and Varuna,
spirit and energy, ruler and the people, both of you
sustain and adorn the three houses of the social order:
Executive, Legislature, and Education (Rajarya Sabha,
Dharmarya Sabha and Vidyarya Sabha), and you
maintain all the various ancient values, forms and
institutions of the society. Moving with thought and
imagination here itself, I have seen the gandharvas,
leaders gifted with speech and ideas flying on the wings
of the winds, committed to the sanctity of duty in the
holy social order of yajna, serving and sustaining the
earth and her environment.






Sages of vision and imagination measure and
describe the nature, character and forms of the earth by
the speech and words of this divine and generous Indra,
lord of light and knowledge and speech. And these sages
and poets, wondrous makers of forms in words and
materials, watching the light and energy of divinity in

of body, mind and soul for the individual and the nation.
He listens. He rises lustrous and blazing at the call for
defence and victory, destroys the demons of darkness,
violence and poverty in the strifes, breaks the clouds of
rain showers and collects the trophies of excellence and
glory for his people.

mind and soul into divine awareness, celebrated in yajna
and the sacred ways of life, blessed and blissful, like
the dawn, adorned in the purest garb of immaculate
words and verses, coexistent with Divine consciousness
and abiding with fatherly sages, may that holy light of
the Vedic Word be ours.






Just as cosmic energy creates the twin lights of
the sun and moon, and just as the sun radiates the circuit
of light energy that creates the Ashvins, which then bring
forth the dawn, which inspires the tip of the tongue in
adoration, and the twin flow of light currents dispelling
darkness serves to reveal the objects of the world, so




does Indra, lord omniscient create the twins of
Revelation, word and meaning of the Vedic speech,
which both activate the tip of the tongue in spontaneous
articulation and stay there. They both together,
dispelling the darkness of ignorance in the light of
knowledge, stay, serve the world of created objects and
stay there in the memory.




4. Nakiresam nindita matryesu ye asmakam pitaro


None among living humanity is reviler and
maligner of those who are our ancestors, parents and

power and generosity, hero of divine actions, strengthens
them with firmness of will and action and creates fortifi-
cations for their traditions, institutions and familial lines.


Where, in the human body, when the soul is


anxious to know the mystery of truth and light divine,
does it find the holy cows of the Lord Supreme, words

there in the body itself, with nine friendly faculties of
freshest powers (five pranic energies and mind, intellect,
memory and self-awareness), and with another team of
ten friends (five pranic energies and five senses),
following the path of truth in meditation, the soul
discovers the sun, Light Divine, self-refulgent, existing
in the depth of the self, otherwise covered under
existential darkness of ignorance.

learned poet and artist.

celestial oceans with showers of bliss for the man of
might and high charity.

and push on the battles, and create fearlessness all round
for us.






Indra, ordainer, preserver and sustainer of the
cycle of seasons, protect and promote the soma distilled

Protect and promote the Maruts, storm troops of yours
who, in your service, destroy adversaries, dispel

and celebrate with those wise scholars and sages who
exhilarate, exalt and enlighten you in the joy of victory.






Here on the yajna vedi of our social order, for
the latest modes of defence and protection, we invoke,
exalt and celebrate Indra, commander of the stormy

favours, progressive and advancing in glory, universal
glorious, all patient and all victorious, blazing brave

Mandala 3/Sukta 48
Indra Devata, Vishvamitra Gathina Rshi






The newly risen sun, mighty generous and
beautiful, protects the essence of food in order to sustain
and promote it for life. Indra, O sun, drink first the good
and delicious essence of soma mixed with milk as it
suits your desire, and protect and promote the soma for
life.

(The mantra also applies to the brilliant ruler of
the social order, and every new authority of taxation
and the defence, protection, promotion and development
of the people and the order, the primary aim being
happiness and progress of society with taxes as the
means and not the end strictly, with reference to the
needs of the system.


The mantra can also apply to the birth of human
life, its growth and maturity. It can be applied to the
birth of the sun itself in the process of creative evolution.
In short, Indra should be interpreted as the sun, the
human soul, 1.e., jivatma, the creative energy and the
ruler.)

Vachya Rshi

observances of divine forces in nature and in humanity.
Enchanters cannot transgress them, wise men of steady
mind do not violate them. Neither heaven and earth,
nor scholars free from hate and jealousy with all their
knowledge, nor the fixed mountains can break or bend

2. Sad bharan eko acaran bibhartyrtam varsistha-


One constant and unmoving bears six burdens.
The moving ones go round the one which is sun and
shower and the universal law. Three great regions go
round in space in constancy. Two remain hidden in the
cave of mystery. One is apparently seen.


(The one unmoving is Ishvara who creates
Mahat and five elements from Prakrti. Three great ones
are Bhu, earth, Bhuvah, the middle region of the sky,
and Svah, the region of light, of which the higher two
are unseen while the earth is seen. Another interpretation
is that the one unmoving is the sun, the six are the
seasons. The one constant can be interpreted as Prakrti
also which bears Mahat and the elements and the three
greats as sattva, rajas and tamas. The mantra is mystical
and mysterious and the beauty is deep in mystery.)





The sun and shower and the Law is lord of three
worlds, bears the forms of the universe, feeds the three
worlds like the mother cow, sustains all and fathers the
children of existence. Three are his beautiful forces,




sattva, rajas and tamas. Lord of highest power, he rules
and sustains all. Lord of power, sun and shower, he bears
the seed of all the universal forms of existence.

him and from him.

and life in all cosmic acts of creation and sustenance.
Three are the rolling floods of light, air and waters, in
heaven and skies and on the earth. Of the vision, thought
and expression of the sagely poets and Rshis, he is the
origin and inspiration. Three are the streams of causal,
subtle and physical energy with cosmic truth and law
flowing to the life on earth like youthful maidens rushing


MANDAL - 3 / SUKTA - 57 1217


to meet their lover. Three are the regions and three the
lights, agni (fire) on earth, vayu (air and electricity) in
the sky, and aditya (light) in heaven, sustaining life in
the cosmic yajna in three sessions.




6. Trira divah savitarvaryani divediva a suva trirno


Savita, lord creator and giver of light and life
and inspiration, bring us three of the choicest blessings

metals of excellent order. O lord of honour and
excellence, saviour and sustainer, O heaven and earth,
O mother Sarasvati, bear and bring us the patience,
courage and fighting strength for winning the victories
of life.





Thrice does Savita shower us with inspiration
and energy from the light of heaven, so do Mitra and
Varuna, refulgent powers of nature and humanity,
friendly, just, and generous of hands. Indeed, the flowing
waters, heaven and earth and the wide firmament, all




pray for the gifts of light, wealth and power from this
lord Savita for yajnic advancement in life.




8. Triruttama dunasa rocanani trayo rajantya-


Three are the best and highest lights, formidable
and indestructible: fire, electricity and the solar energy.
These three brave and heroic powers of the lord of light
and life’s energy shine in the world. Heroes of truth
and cosmic law and the fluent light of rectitude, vibrant
and tempestuous, blazing brilliant far and wide, may,
we pray, shine like divinities thrice and threefold in the
yajnic battles of life by virtue of the lights of heaven.

yields the abundant milk of knowledge. Agni and Indra,


MANDAL - 3 / SUKTA - 57 1217


the powerful and the brilliant, are great admirers of this
understanding and language of knowledge.






Indra and Pusha, the power and the pranic
energy of divine nature, generous and inexhaustible with
open hands like happy friends, shower the gifts of the
light of heaven and reveal it in the language of divinity.
Brilliancies of the world rejoice in the acquisition of
this light of knowledge and language. O Vasus, scholars
of the first order, I wish and pray I may benefit from the
pleasure and peace of your gifts of light, knowledge

grace of manner, bring in on the vedi of home yajna all
the sagely souls worthy of reverence and let them drink

contribution to the material prosperity and cultural grace
of a happy home.)

Agni, Agni- Varuna Devata, Vamadeva Gautama Rshi






Agni, light and fire of life, brilliant and
impassioned people always kindle you to action. Quick,
relentless and refulgent, a very home of rest and peace
and light as you are, they kindle and raise you with their
best and noblest effort and action. O men, join, honour
and respect this divine and imperishable power among
humanity to full force of illumination, generate this holy
power, intelligent, universal and living light for all,
generate and develop it to full beauty and delight over
the wide earth.





All rights reserved with publisher. Not for commercial or non-commercial distribution.




And O light and fire of life, Agni, bring in your
brother and complementary power, Varuna, the very
spirit of cool, peace and justice of life, and direct him
toward the noble and brilliant performers of yajna. Bring
him well with best thoughts and intentions, bring the
lover of yajna, highest and most venerable, partner in
social organisation, observer of the laws and operations
of universal truth and goodness, refulgent as the sun,
sustainer of humanity, brilliant ruler, universally
accepted and consecrated by the people.






Agni, O friend, loving and gracious, destroyer
of enemies, just as a swift horse by a fast moving chariot
on the highway and the wheel of Time drives the master
to the destination, so come, hasten your friend Varuna,
power of peace and justice, to us. O refulgent master of
knowledge, being friends with Varuna, the winds and
the solar lights of the world, the people and brilliant
eminences of the world, reach us, bring us the peace
and joy of life. Blazing brilliant and gracious, bring
peace and well-being for our children and grand
children. O lord of light and knowledge, love and justice,

6. Asya Srestha subhagasya samdrg devasya citra-


Open, highest and most wonderful among
mortals are the gifts and actions of this brilliant,
generous and glorious ruler, pure and bright like the
heated clarified ghrta of the inviolable cow, lovely and
profuse like the liberality of the abundant cow, mother
earth, and the inexhaustible speech of self-refulgent lord
of omniscience. He watches all and his gifts are directly




7. Trirasya ta parama santi satya sparha devasya


Three are the supreme manifestations of the
generous refulgent Agni, true, lovely and universally
cherished which arise and shine. Pervasive everywhere
in endless space in the presence of the infinite divine
lord of the universe, he shines pure, refulgent, generous
and beautiful.


(This mantra refers to the various manifestations
of cosmic energy which is the existential potential of
the Supreme Lord Creator operating at different levels
in different modes. In other words, we may call it the
manifestations of Adi-Shakti, the Lord’s consort Prakrti,
originally manifesting as sattva, rajas, and tamas.

MANDAL - 4 / SUKTA - 1 5


On earth, Bhuloka, it is fire and magnetic energy,
which is agni. In the middle regions of the sky,
Bhuvahloka, it is electrical energy, which is vayu. In
the higher regions of light, Svahloka, it is aditya, solar
energy. The sun too manifests in three different phases,
at dawn, at noon and in the evening when it is setting.
The efficacy of the sun in these three phases is different.


At the individual human level, it is physical
energy, mental energy and spiritual energy. In yet
another way it is the vital heat which maintains the
physical body, i1.e., annamaya kosha; it is pranic energy
which maintains the pranamaya kosha and the
manomaya kosha; and it is the higher psychic energy
which maintains the vijnanamaya kosha and the
anandamaya kosha. Of these three, one feeds, the other
energises, and the third illumines.


However, mantras such as this have to be
interpreted in a state of meditation, and since meditation
is the birth-right of every human being, we are free to
divine into the mystery of the mantric vision in our

sweets and fragrances. Riding a golden chariot drawn

as well as flames of fire, majestic in body form, always
rejoicing and emanating joy, he is a very treasure home
of prosperity, happiness and excellence like an assembly
house of power, governance and wealth of a nation in




9. Sa cetayanmanuso yajnabandhuh pra tam mahya


A brother yajaka on the yajna vedi of creation
and governance, he awakens and enlightens the people.
To him they move on to consecrate him in the seat of
power and yajna with a long rope of powers, obligations
and controls for balance. He abides in the seat of
governance and justice fulfilling his roles, generous and
brilliant, achieving the dreams and realities of the
nation’s imagination.

it manifests in the sun as light, and then in the middle
regions of space as vayu, electricity. Moving without
head and feet, concealed yet joining youthfully the
inmates of various regions, light in the sun, cloud in the
sky, homes of people and depth of the earth, it operates

ever true and dynamic destroyer of evil, is fixed in the

greatness it is the invoker and harbinger of natural
bounties, most worthy of reverence with homage of
oblations for the purification, illumination and
inspiration of mankind. And Agni is held, recognised
and realised in the heart.

exaltation of his innate wealth of honour and grandeur.






Who is the brave who reaches the ecstasy of the
lord’s company? Who attains to him and shares the
manifestations of his vision and intelligence? When does
he know and realise the wonder and variety of this lord’s
benediction? When does the lord’s grace flow for the
protection and advancement of the supplicant in yajna?






When does Indra listen to the supplicant? And
while he listens, when does he grant that the time for
his liberation and ultimate protection is come? What
are, for sure, the ultimate bounds (if any) of the lord’s
gifts of grace? How do the celebrants sing of the
gracious lord for the supplicant?

When would the refulgent and generous lord in

O lord, when and how shall we describe your
firm and protective love and friendship and your
brotherly affection to our friends?


The cosmic body of this gracious lord and the
various stages of his creation are for the beauty and
glory of existence, blissful as heaven, various and most
wondrous. So also are the beauties and generosities of
the sun for the love and sustenance of life.






Keen to eliminate the hateful, destructive and

Indra, world ruler, omnipotent lord of universal

O citizens of the land, what is that order of praise

He is to be invoked in the battles against
darkness, evil and crime, lord adorable as he is, profusely
adored, Indra, lord of honour and excellence, achiever
of truth and giver of noble riches. He, lord of wealth,
might and majesty, bears and bestows choice gifts of
honour and freedom upon the mortals who dedicate
themselves to the lord of existence and pray for success
and divine grace in the ways of life.






People and leaders both call upon him in their
battles of life in search of freedom, those who seek
release and those who look to him for the protection of
their bodies. Together, men and women, men and
leaders, go to him for freedom from suffering as well as
for the well being of their children and grand children.

People of the land, both bright and blazing as

pursuit of knowledge and yajnic action do their best
and holiest in faith in their own fields of social
development freely, and when all the citizens thus
engage in battle against the demons of darkness, evil

a war footing, they unitedly and unanimously choose
Indra as their guide and leader in action.






And then the warriors all work for the honour

honour and excellence and joy for humanity, and one

Whoever for Indra, today, distils and ripens the
soma of honour and excellence, confirms and

The poor ignorant trader buys the pleasure of

got.” No, not now. With all that he can surrender, he
cannot redeem even a little of what he has lost. The
poor as well as the intelligent get back only what they
bargain for in word and action.






Who can buy this Indra, this spiritual glory, from
me for all time with the ten senses and their pleasure?
None. Yes, when one dispels the evils of darkness,

6. Supravyah prasusdlesa virah susveh paktim


Indra, leader and ruler, instant destroyer of
enmity, 1s openly accessible to the person who creates
and produces good things and thus contributes positively
to the peace, progress and happiness of life, and he fully
protects and promotes such people and raises them to
maturity as the sun ripens grain. But to the person who
is uncreative, and malignant scandalizer, he is not
accessible, not a friend, or a brother, or protector, in
fact he is awfully opposed to such negatives.

(Creativity and a positive, contributive attitude
to life is a value, while uncreativeness and a negative,
destructive attitude is a dangerous disvalue. The former
is to be protected and promoted, but the latter has to be
opposed and eliminated.)

Not with the miserly man of wealth does Indra
bargain any friendship since he is the master creator of
peace and joy and lover of honour and excellence. He
does not acknowledge, much less approve of the wealth
of the ungenerous. In fact, he exposes the wealth of the
hoarder until, exposed and ashamed, he is reduced to
nullity, because, basically and exclusively he is for the
creative and generous who produce and mature the
wealth of the nation to the state of honour and dignity.




8. Indram pare’vare madhyamasa indram yanto’-


People at the farthest and at the nearest, highest
and lowest, and people at the middle, all call upon Indra,
lord of honour and excellence. People on the move and
those at the end of the journey call upon Indra, lord of
peace and security. People settled in the home and
warriors on the battle field call upon Indra, lord of
prosperity and victory. And the leaders of the people
and the men fighting for food, struggling for energy
and panting for speed and progress call upon Indra, lord
giver of food, energy and advancement.

heavenly bird of light wings, the sun, which moves by
its own mighty force without wheels and which is prime
among the powers of nature, the Maruts, may bring for
humanity food and energy blest by the best and brilliant
bounties of Divinity.






When the bird of the wings of light, vibrating
as sunrays, flying fast as thought by the wide paths of

That womb of nature couldn’t hold me against
my will and pleasure. I sat in there with all my vigour

the falcon bird of the spirit, rising up and high, crosses
the storms and shears of winds to freedom.




When the falcon bird of the spirit descends from

When the Rbhus, sages and scientists, through
service and action, receive instruction from parents and
teachers, and have done enough to their own satisfaction
and satisfaction of the seniors, they graduate to join the
fraternity of the enlightened, and then, constant in study
and meditation, bring about maturity and fullness of
mind and spirit for independent work.






And then they, the Rbhus, who, with their
knowledge and dedicated service, rejuvenate their
parents and senior generation grown old, nerveless and
almost lying like a broken pillar, and bring them back
to their youthful time, thus keeping the tradition young
and alive: may they, vigorous geniuses, far reaching in
imagination, marvellous in invention, mighty and
majestic in achievement, and brilliant and blissful in
conduct, come to our yajna of science and research,
protect us and promote our progress and advancement
far ahead.

MANDAL - 4 / SUKTA - 33 163


The Rbhus, sages and scholars of genius and
knowledge, bold and blissful, who protect the cow,
mother knowledge and the speech of knowledge, and
also the mother earth like nursing a holy child, those
who serve the mother tradition and rejuvenate and
strengthen every part of its body like a darling love,
who bring new vigour and new lights to its body of
science and knowledge, they, the Rbhus, attain to
immortality in the living history of the advancement of
human civilisation by these noble acts of holiness.






The eldest of the Rbhus says: Let us make two
cups for the drink of soma for the celebration of life’s
enlightenment. The younger, more brilliant, says: Let
us make three. The youngest, most brilliant, says: Let
us make four. Tvashta, the teacher, universal lord maker
of forms, O Rbhus, honours and praises these words of
yours. (Thus knowledge, science and technology grows
from one generation of scholars to another.)


The four cups of life may be interpreted as
material and mental fulfilment, and Moksha, ultimate
purpose of living and ultimate freedom.

the divine maker, wise and all-seeing eye of the world,
who sees the Rbhus’ cups of life shining as daylight
sees them, loves them and blesses the makers. Thus
should men do in life.






When the scholars and sages of the science of
yajna remain on holiday for twelve days in the years,
resting and refreshing themselves, enjoying the
hospitality of a prominent host, then the sky is overcast,
the showers pour, fields are made fertile, the rivers flow
and vegetation grows on barren lands, (and this by rain

protection, and dexterous of hand as they are.






The wonderful acts and products of these Rbhus,
exceptional scientists, later, the younger intellectuals,
themselves brilliant with their mind and work, honour
and apply for further development: thus the food and
energy becomes the favourite input for the ‘devas’,
following researchers, for higher outputs of finer food
and energy, the powerful thunderbolt becomes the arm
for Indra, ruler and defender, and the extensive waves
of subtle transmission become the perceptive and active
agencies of Varuna, the presiding power.

Atma, Indra- Varuna Devata,
Trasadasyu Paurukutsya Rshi






I am Indra, sovereign spirit of the universe.
Twofold is my kingdom: heaven and earth, or, the world
of nature and the world of humanity. I am Varuna,
highest Intelligence and the Ruling Power of the
universe. All the Immortals, divine forces in the service
of Varuna are ours, they comprise and conduct the
mighty yajna system of the universe. Thus I rule all: the
world of humanity, all that is highest and closest in the
world of forms, and all that is hidden.


(This mantra is a metaphor of the living,
breathing, intelligent, self-organising, autonomous and
sovereign system of the universe as macrocosm as well
as microcosm. At the macrocosmic level, Indra is the
Supreme Sovereign, immanent and transcendent Spirit,
and Varuna is the immanent ruling force, intelligence
and the law of Rtam. Indra-varuna is a functional version
of the Supreme Spirit which is both immanent and
transcendent. At the microcosmic level, Indra- Varuna

intelligence, mind and senses. At the world level too,
Indra- Varuna may be interpreted as the Ruler and the






I am Varuna, ruling spirit of the world, best and
highest. For me do the first manifestations of the spirit
in nature hold the wealth and power of existence. They
are the divine immortals who comprise and conduct the
creative yajna, the spirit in body form. I rule the world
of humanity, the phenomenal forms and all that is hidden
in potentiality.






I am Indra, the highest, omnipotent, and
transcendent. I am Varuna, highest and best immanent
and omniscient. Happy and exalted, having created the
vast and deep and firm heaven and earth as Tvashta,
cosmic maker, I hold and move in unison the sun and
earth and all other regions of the universe.

space of nature within eternal law. By the same eternal
law of mine, the child of eternity, the threefold world of
natural constituents, sattva, rajas and tamas (thought,
energy and matter) manifests and expands and keeps to
the law. Thus do I create, hold and rule the universe.






The best of men and leaders, equipped with good
horses and modes of transport and communication,
fighting for strength and sustenance, the chosen ones,
knowing me and struggling to attain to me call upon
me in the battle of existence. I, Indra, commanding the
wealth and power of the world, highest of the lustre
and glory in existence, create the battle for their victory

that’s mine, mysterious and unknown. When the flames
of my soma yajna rise, the fire crackles and the hymns
of celebration reverberate, the boundless heaven and
earth shake in fear. There is none that equals me.





That greatness and grandeur of yours all the
scholars of the worlds know. O lord omniscient, you
yourself speak of it to the selected men of vision. You
are the breaker of the clouds, we hear, and you set the
rivers aflow and release the waters locked up in lakes
and clouds.




8. Asmakamatra pitarasta asantsapta rsayo daur-


When the seven sages, senses, pranic energies
and flowing streams, which are our feeding and
sustaining powers like father and mother, are locked up

light and life is restored).

you give it on to this earth’s ruler, destroyer of darkness
and evil, who presides over half the world (and rises in
majesty with the break of dawn).

without break. Reveal that language of enlightenment,

it in life. May the Lord Omniscient so close to us hear it
well chanted in celebration, the same Lord of Vak, the
eternal Word, who commands the four Vedas as high
peaks of knowledge and breathes out the same for us in
revelation.






Of this mighty self-refulgent Lord, Word and
Dharma, four are the high peaks of light and self
proclamation: Rgveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and
Atharva-veda; three legs on which it rests: jnana or
knowledge, karma or action, and upasana or prayer; two
heads: abhyudaya or worldly well being, and Nihshreyas
or moksha or ultimate freedom; seven hands or the seven
verse forms. Three way bound in faith, action and
meditation, it is the thundervoice of Divinity which
proclaims itself through the beauty, wonder and terror
of nature and the music of the Veda. And this mighty
presence of mighty self-refulgent Lord and the self-
awareness of omniscience is enshrined in the heart of

MANDAL - 4 / SUKTA - 58 249


Ghrta, the essence of the nature, purpose and
science of life, three way hidden in mystic language
and held by natural forces, the enlightened ones
discover, create and produce: Indra, cosmic energy,
electricity, thunder and lightning, holds and reflects one,
the sun holds and radiates another, and the third they
discover from their meditation on Divinity with their
own vision and intelligence.






These streams of light and life’s energy flow in
a hundred streams from the innermost depth of the heart-
ocean, but not perceptible to the negative soul. Residing
in the golden grove, myself wrapped in golden hue in
their midst, I watch the light all round, the gold and the
essence of life.

These streams of light and life flow like

As youthful ladies of love and virtue, inspired

Mandala 5/Sukta 1
Agni Devata, Budha-Gavishthara of Atreya Family Rshis






Agni is seen and known while rising by the
burning samidhas lighted by the yajakas at dawn coming
up like a cow early in the morning, and the flames, like
branches of a mighty tree, rise brilliantly and touch the
sky where there is no pain, no darkness.






The yajaka Agni, good at heart, is seen to invoke
the divinities and noble sages to the yajna and rises high
while the fire keeps burning and rising. The light of the
burning fire is seen as a blissful divine power and then
the great refulgent sun rises from the night’s darkness.

When the pure and lustrous fire of yajna, as the
sun, rises with its pure bright flames and takes over the
reins of the conduct of the yajnic world around, then
the invigorating and powerful dakshina offering is made
with the ladles, the flames of fire rise high, and the fire
higher and higher up voraciously consumes the offering.



4. Aghimaccha devayatam manamsi caksumsiva


The minds of holy celebrants of Divinity turn
intently to Agni as their eyes wait for and turn to the

light appears and the world grows bright.

Ruler of the world, you are the self-refulgent
light of heaven, illuminator of spaces and mover of the

giver. He is the lord and controller of power and

cloud, the seedling in the womb of existence, ever
young, unaging, antidote of negative destruction, and
loving support of all.

O children of the earth, for your good and
comfort, immediate as well as distant, are these united,
cooperative, well controlled radiations of the sun all

way: For that Master Spirit, the sun sucks up the vapours
of water from the ocean and other lower places by well
directed, all dominating waves of light, and then makes
the cloud release the waters in rain showers to flow down
in streams and rivers into the ocean.


(In the same way the administrative forces of
the ruler, working together in cooperation within the
law, collect the taxes from the various communities of
the people and the ruler uses the collection for rain
showers of the people’s protection, promotion and
prosperity without hoarding anything for himself.)

Brilliant sages with holy songs of adoration

sun of divine knowledge opens the doors of human
reason and intelligence with knowledge.

The sun takes on the refulgent form of beauty

regions of light rise on, expansive like a measured
column of the day’s sustenance.

the previous mantra, of the expansion of the light of

yoga yajna, it rises over the bright and blazing world of
existence, the seven lights of natural powers, perceptive
and well directed by the soul in the state of constancy,
carry it over the waters around waiting for its orders, and
the soul reaches its destination where it joins the Divine.

radiations of light and intelligence collected from the
nourishing and sustaining divinities of nature and
humanity, awakening, enlightening, speaking loud and
bold, and preparing the daughter for life in the home
with knowledge and wisdom. (The Dawn is mother, the
earth is daughter.)


(The mother of the home, and the mother teacher

The mighty deep and generous ocean of waters,
the blazing sustainer bird of space, the sun, enters in
the spatial womb of its mother, divine Nature, fertilized

it traverses on and on, lights up, sustains and marks the

Ever and instantly, this nation shines and

1. A rudrasa indravantah sajosaso hiranyarathah


O Rudras, powers of justice, rectitude and
dispensation, commanding honour, power and
excellence of the world, loving kind and friendly, going
by golden chariots of glory with gifts of good fortune,
prosperity and well being for all, this love, desire,
understanding and prayer of us all is addressed to you:
Come like a wave of divine nectar for the thirsty waiting
for a drink on the shore.






O Maruts, tempestuous heroes of the world,
children of the essence of nature in love with the earth,
you are blest with the voice of thunder, light of
knowledge, wisdom and understanding of the speed of
mind, mighty bows, unfailing arrows and inexhaustible
quivers, noble steeds and excellent chariots and the best
arms and armaments. Go forward, noble heroes, and do
good to all.




All rights reserved with publisher. Not for commercial or non-commercial distribution.


MANDAL - 5 / SUKTA - 57 473




O Maruts, children of the firmament, winds and
tempests of nature’s energy, you agitate the regions of
light, break the clouds and shake the mountains to create
wealth for the generous giver. At your approach forests
shake with fear and the earth vibrates when in a state of
passion for water showers you join and charge the clouds
of vapour.




4. Vatatviso maruto varsanirnijo yama iva susa-


The Maruts command the fury and splendour
of the winds. Cleansed and anointed by holy water, they
replete the showers of love and justice all the year round.
They are highly impressive and handsome in body and
mind as self-controlled people are. They command the
moderate yellow as well as the intense red flames of
the yajnic fires of life’s dynamics. Untouched by sinful
involvements, refined and discriminative in thought and
judgement, they are refulgent like the sun and large-
hearted like space by virtue of their innate greatness.




All rights reserved with publisher. Not for commercial or non-commercial distribution.






Universally generous like the perennial stream
of soma and showers of nature’s joy, versatile of form
and action as light in spectrum colours, holy and vastly
charitable, they see the reality in all its variety of true
colours as light reveals the real forms without screen
effects. Commanding imperishable wealth, power and
competence in their own right by birth and genetic merit
of previous karma, they wear their beauty and regality
of life and conduct in their heart and hands. Loving,
brilliant and adorable, the Maruts define, deserve, serve
and thus justify the name and description: Immortal.




6. Rstayo vo maruto amsayoradhi saha ojo bahvorvo


O Maruts, leading lights of humanity, on your
shoulders you bear the blazing lances and the burdens
of forbearance with courage and splendour of life, while
the force of action is concentrated in your hands. On

progress in your chariots. Indeed, the entire wealth and
honour, beauty and grace of life reflects in your body
and personality.

with strong wheels of initiative and advancement, the
Maruts proceed with showers of new life as leaders and
pioneers of a new age, and as they proceed, the dormant
vapours of life agitate with new ferment and join the
rays of the sun, the cloud roars with thunder and
lightning and the earth receives the showers of new life.






As the Maruts proceed, the earth waxes with
desire and fertility. Like the husband man, the Maruts
shower their own vitality on earth as the seed of new
life. Thus do the Maruts, forces of new life, generative
and enlightened, commanding power and judgement,

bonds of mortality to freedom. O Ashvins, harbingers

release saptavadhri, the spirit that has lived out the
fivefold sense experience and the two-fold adventure
of thought and desire.




6. Bhitaya nadhamanaya rsaye saptavadhraye.


Ashvins, complementary powers of evolution,
discrimination and vision, for the man in fear of
existence, for the supplicant in sufferance, for the sage

and mind, for all these, with your divine powers, let the
tree of life seed and grow well for experience and then
let it fall off for the soul’s freedom.


Expectant mother, just as the breeze of life feeds
and vibrates the pool of lotus life all round, so may your


foetus in the womb vibrate with life and growth and be
born when it matures in ten months.

of the earth and her social order for me, and I pray you

master from the pasture, as friends rush to meet a friend,
as people having performed good actions by nature and
law advance to receive their prize, and as the sun rays
radiate across space and sky to meet the variegated earth,

Indra Devata, Vasishtha Maitravaruni Rshi






Undistilled soma does not please Indra, lord of
humanity. Nor do distillations of soma unsanctified by
divine chants of Veda satisfy the lord of power and
divinity. Therefore I create and compose the latest song
of adoration with Vedic vision with the distillation so
that the lord may listen and accept our homage of soma
with pleasure.






With every chant of song divine, the soma
pleases Indra. At every stage of adoration, at every step
of the song, the draughts of soma exhilarate the lord.
For this reason, surely, eager supplicants, equally
proficient, invoke and offer homage to the lord for
protection and progress like children approaching
parents with love to have their blessings.

so should Indra first and foremost look after and refine
the development of knowledge and all the pursuers.

wisdom celebrate Indra, the soul and generous ruler of

Indra is the sovereign ruler of the moving world
and her people on the earth. Whatever various and
manifold wealth there is on the earth, he alone is the

you rise invincible for any power of the world.





Indra, by your ethics and policy you guide the
leading lights of humanity and those called upon to duty
as you light up the earth and space, and thus surely by
nature and character you rise to the mighty power of
the governance of the great social order. Truly the mighty

then he, Varuna, with justice and power, may cause it to
be reduced to half and then purged off.






We speak and sing, thus, of Indra, this lord of
power, honour and excellence who gives us great wealth
and further capacity for success and victory and who
accepts homage as the most loving protector of the

protect and promote us with all gifts of good fortune

nation, when the days of enlightenment and good
fortune shine and you bear the banner of light and
victory in battles of progress, symbol of the nation’s
excellence, then Agni, brilliant leader and light giver,

them at the head of yajna as the priest giving life and
energy for further good fortune and higher progress.

The fire on high radiates light inspiring pleasure
and enlightenment. The dawn as veteran lady of the

The yajamana and his wife together move forward as
by chariot on way to yajna to adore the lord, and the
priest offers to join the yajna like one inspired.




2. Pra vavrje supraya barhiresama vispativa birita


The yajna of these people proceeds, richly
provided with holy materials. Vayu and Pusha, wind
and life-giving sun, like guardian rulers and protectors
of the people, move across the skies as if riding a chariot
drawn by horses at the sacred call of night and dawn to
yajna early for the good of humanity.






Let the Vasus, life giving energies of nature, and
enlightened people settled at peace in learning, abound
and rejoice here on earth. Let radiant purities of divine
refulgence from yajna rise to the vast sky and purify
the atmosphere. Let divine energies of vast extension




receive and respond to this yajnic code of our
participation in nature’s dynamics and converge on this
way to our earth.






All those divinities of the world, adorable and
conjoined in nature’s dynamics of cosmic yajna, are
catalytic agents of protection and promotion keenly
concentrative toward life’s evolution and advancement.
O generous yajamana, O bright fire, keen and passionate
as they are in yajna, join them in yajna right away: join
Bhaga, universal treasure of wealth, honour and
excellence, Nasatya, constant complementarities of
nature and natural law, and Purandhi, keeper and
protector of habitations and institutions.






O sage and scholar, bring us the knowledge and
the language of the knowledge of heaven and earth.

and creates today, right now we may share and, in
participation together, be beneficiaries of this lord’s
jewel gifts of life.

Nature, Vayu, the wind, and Bhaga, lord of power and
glory, bestow upon us what they produce, promote and
preserve for us.


MANDAL - 7/ SUKTA - 40 163






Surely that person would be strong and brilliant
whom the Maruts, great commanders of the power of

Agni, brilliant leader of divinities, and Sarasvati, spirit
of knowledge and speech, inspire, energise and
motivate.

and crime without hurt or violence.








Of this generous, self-refulgent, creative and
omnipresent lord Vishnu, all divinities and varieties of
existence are extensive manifestations like branches of
a tree, in this well sustained system of the universe by
virtue of the homage they offer and the sustenance they
receive. Rudra, lord sustainer of the good and scourage
of evil, alone knows the mighty majesty I adore, and I
pray may the Ashvins, sun and moon and twin divine
complementarities of nature’s energy, come by the paths
of divine bounties and bless us.

Mandala 7/Sukta 60


Surya, Mitra-Varuna Devatah, Vasishtha
Maitravaruni Rshi






O sun, while you arise today, purify us and
proclaim to Mitra and Varuna, presiding powers of day
and night and upholders of earth, sky and heaven, that
we are free from sin. O Aditi, immortal mother earth
and Infinity, O Aryaman, lord of justice and the paths
of rectitude, dedicated as we are to the divinities,
celebrating and glorifying them, hold us dear as
dedicated to you.






Mitra and Varuna, this is the sun that pervades
both gross and subtle worlds, watcher and light giver
of humanity, which rises across the sky over the earth
and witnesses both the simple and the crooked ways of
action among the mortals. It is the protector, life giver


and promoter of the moving and the unmoving world.






The sun, like a charioteer harnessing his horses,
radiates seven rays of light which from the solar region
carry the energy of light and cosmic waters and bring
about the nights as they withdraw. The sun, also, joining
and pervading various regions, the prana and udana
energies of life and the origins of causal entities,
of which it is the centre.




4. Ud vam [56.50 madhumanto asthura suryo


For you, O men and women, the friendly cloud
and the vast skies replete with honey sweets abide on
high and the sun raises vitalising oceans of vapour, the
sun for which the Adityas, months of the year, Varuna
and Aryama, Adityas all together, prepare the paths
across the zodiacs, Mitra.




MANDAL - 7/ SUKTA - 60 219




These Adityas, Mitra, Varuna and Aryama,
loving friend, discriminative judge, and the path maker
of rectitude, give us the sense and awareness of right
and wrong, of falsehood as distinct from truth and
correctness, in all varieties of situations. And they
persist, and they augment the order of truth and right in
the house of divine law, children of mother Infinity as
they are, happy at peace, loving and kind, yet dauntless
and unchallengeable.




6. Ime mitro varuno dilabhaso ’cetasam ciccitayanti


These powers of love and friendship, judgement
and rectitude and universal truth and law are rare and
undaunted, and with their intelligence and expertise of
method, they awaken even the stupid and ignorant to
sensitivity and wisdom. Further, inspiring the man of
noble mind and holy action, they protect him from
crookedness and sin and lead him on by the path of
truth, goodness and beauty to higher attainment.








The ever vigilant powers of light and love,
judgement and discrimination of right knowledge and
right action, know of heaven and earth and constantly
guide the ignorant to wake up and move on the right
path. Even in the depth of rivers in flood, there is ground
to stand on, a ford to cross. May Mitra, Varuna and
Aryama take us across the deep seas of existence by




8. Yad gopavadaditih sarma bhadram mitro


When, like the lord ruler of the earth and
protector of her children, Aditi, Mitra and Varuna,
mother nature and her law, and divine powers of love,
friendship and judgement provide a blessed home of
peace, plenty and joy for the generous man of noble
action and charity, then in that state of good fortune
we, all dynamic and enthusiastic fast achievers, in the
joyous company of our children and grand children must
not do anything to affront our sages, seniors and scholars
or to violate the sanctity of the divinities of nature and




MANDAL - 7/ SUKTA - 60 221


2. Ava vedim hotrabhiryajeta ripah kascid varuna-


One who dishonours and desecrates the vedi of
yajna with unholy chant and stingy insulting libation of
holy offerings suffers. What sin and suffering does he
not face when he is shaken by Varuna, power of justice
and discrimination? May Aryama, divine guide and path
maker, keep him away along with the jealous and the
hostile, and may Mitra and Varuna, liberal givers, create
and award the generous yajaka with a happy home and
vast freedom of spirit in an age and environment of bliss.






The nature, character and policy of these divine
powers of love and friendship, justice and
discrimination, and thought and action in rectitude is
mysteriously integrated, brilliant and blazing. They
move and act with patience, fortitude and irresistible
force. O generous powers, shakers of the jealous and
the enemies with fear, save us and let us prosper in peace
and joy with the grandeur of your power and force.






11. Yo brahmane sumatim-ayajate vajasya satau


Whoever applies his holy and faithful mind for
the vision of Divinity and for the achievement of food
and energy and supreme wealth, honour and excellence
of life, the generous divine powers energise his righteous
passion and bless his action, and they create a vast house
of joy and prosperity for him and award him golden
wealth and irresistible vitality.



12. lLyam deva purohitiryuvabhyam yajnesu mitrava-


O divine Mitra and Varuna, powers of love and
judgement of nature and humanity, this homage of
reverence is created and offered in your honour in the
congregations of academic and socio-economic yajna.
Pray protect us, promote us, help us cross the hurdles
of life with action and bless us with complete fulfilment.
O generous powers, save us, defend us and let us
advance with all round peace and security for all time.

Mitra- Varuna Devate, Vasishtha Maitravaruni Rshi




MANDAL - 7/ SUKTA - 61 223




O Varuna, up rises the sun, bright and beautiful
eye of you both, Mitra and Varuna, divine pranic
energies of the universe, spreading the light far and wide
over spaces. It illuminates and reveals all regions of the
world, and awakens and inspires all mortals’ love for
life and living.






O Mitra and Varuna, divinities of nature and
humanity, your hymns of knowledge and power, that
vibrant sage and scholar, a veteran reader and long time
listener dedicated to truth and the laws of nature, studies,
proclaims and extends by application. O powers of
divine action, inspire, strengthen and protect his studies
and fulfil his mission with intelligence and revelations
as you fulfil the seasons of the year with natural
evolution of their spirits.









O Mitra and Varuna, light and life of the
universe, generous love and intelligence of nature and
humanity, you transcend the wide earth and the vast
heaven by your dynamic power and sublimity. You vest
life energy and distinct form in herbs and trees and
specific identity in people and their communities while
you preserve and protect the truth of law and the
pursuers of truth with relentless vigil.




4. Samsa mitrasya varunasya dhama susmo rodasi


Study and meditate on the origin and abode of
Mitra and Varuna, pranic energies of nature and human
virtue of love and friendship, light and enlightenment,
and justice and discrimination. By virtue of their great
universal power and force they hold and sustain the earth
and heaven together and yet apart. The time, months
and years of those who do not perform yajna, corporate
acts of social and environmental value, pass by without
the joy of children. On the other hand, those who serve
Divinity, nature and humanity with their heart and soul
cross the paths of life and reach the ultimate freedom of





MANDAL - 7/ SUKTA - 61 225


O wise and generous powers of the world, Mitra
and Varuna, these words of adoration are for you and
your divine gifts to humanity, in which there is nothing
that is not marvellous and nothing that is not divinely
consecrated. Only the jealous and hostile among
humanity indulge in scandal and falsehood, and even
your smallest favours are too deep for the ignorant to
perceive and appreciate.




6. Samu vam yajnam mahayam namobhirhuve vam


O Mitra and Varuna, I invoke and join your great
yajna of universal grandeur with homage especially
when I am faced with challenges and limitations. Your
latest thoughts, visions and revelations are created,

of existence.


O divines, Mitra and Varuna, this song of


adoration is offered to you in your holy congregations

Speak to us so that we may maintain a state of purity

May they, Varuna, Mitra and Agni, happy and
beneficent, healers and destroyers of suffering, keepers

aparna vitalities of wind and respiration, dearest to
humans in the health system.






O Mitra and Varuna, loving and discriminative
pranic vitalities of our health system, extend your power
and energy like helping hands for our life and health
and sprinkle the vital movement of our senses and mind
with liquid rejuvenation and replenishment of energy.
O youthful powers of rejuvenation, vest our people with

by worshipful devotees. May this lord of cosmic light

own majesty nor compromises with his own generosity.

refuse to be managed otherwise.

Varuna Devata, Vasishtha Maitravaruni Rshi






Firm in balance are the creations of this Varuna,
light of the universe, by virtue of his greatness as he
holds and stabilises the heaven and earth and indeed
the expanding universe. He energises and impels the
high heavens of bliss and the distant stars and lights
them both day and night, pervading the vast world of
existence. Only the wise and brave know this.






And when would I, by my own individual self,
commune with the lord? When would I join the
innermost presence of Varuna? Would he accept my
homage and prayer with pleasure? When would I, with
peace in the mind, experience the bliss of that presence
and power?




MANDAL - 7 / SUKTA - 86 303




O Varuna, I ask myself what sin is. Keen for the

sake, to save you from sin.

which you punish your friend and celebrant? Speak of
that to me, O lord rare to be attained, self-refulgent and

from the forefathers. Save us from the sins and evils
committed by ourselves in person. O sovereign ruler,




free us from animal passions, like the thief from jail,
and relieve the earnest celebrant from passions and
slavery, like the calf set free from bonds of the tether.




6. Na sa 5170 dakso varuna dhrutih sa sura manyur-


It is not our own essential virtue, competence
and expertise that is the cause of evil and the fall. It is
liquor, anger, gambling and infatuation, ignorance and
loss of good sense that is the cause of evil. It is also the
company of the wrong senior with the junior and the
dreams of unrealistic ambition that tempt a person to
fall a victim to falsehood and evil.






Let me, an innocent person free from evil, do
unreserved service and offer sincere prayers like a
dedicated servant to Varuna, refulgent and generous lord
giver of sure and complete fulfilment. He, brilliant and

planets and satellites from the stars, all moving in


observance of the cosmic law.






Your spirit, O Varuna, sets the currents of energy
in motion like winds and energises the cosmic particles
anew, once asleep all, now rushing restless for food for
existence like a horse moving for grass. O lord immanent
and transcendent, all this great expansive universe of
heaven and earth, all these abodes of existence, are
homes of life dear to you, dear to the living forms.






Currents of cosmic intelligence which are
observant forces of Varuna appointed to their task,

order, sole ruler and law giver of this world of reality.






O Varuna, lord who save even the sinner, bless
us that we may be sinless, observing the laws of mother
Infinity’s discipline. O lord, O saints and sages, teachers
and rulers, protect and promote us with peace, progress

offered, and inspire and exhort these yajakas for the
appointed tasks of the day.






Aware of the self, knowing your tasks in life,
recognising your powers and potential, dedicated to your

Parjanya Devata, Vasishtha or Kumara Agneya
Maitravaruni Rshi






Chant aloud three voices of the divine Word,
Rk, Sama and Yajush verses of the four Vedas headed
by the light of Divinity symbolised by the eternal Name:
AUM. (They comprise the knowledge, action and
prayerful gratitude of total human endeavour, the three
being ‘jnana, karma and upasana.) With yajna they distil
from the cosmic ocean the milky essence of liquid
vitality, soma, elementary form of the cloud, parjanya.
That parjanya produces the fiery electric current (here-
in called the calf) which then gives rise to the seed of
vegetation in the form of cloud laden with living rain
i.e., the cloud, upon the instant roars and thunders, rains
and fertilises the earth with the seed of vegetation.


Note: An extension of this knowledge of the
evolution of life on earth is found in the science of
‘Panchagni’, five fires, in Chhandogya Upanishad 5, 4-
9, and in Brhadaranyaka Upanish 6, 2, 9-14.
Chhandogya Upanishad is an explanatory extension of
parts of Sama Veda, and Brhadaranyaka Upanishad is a




similar work on parts of Yajur Veda. An indication of
this science is given in Kathopanishad 1, 1, 12-19.
Kathopanishad is an explanatory footnote to Yajur- Veda.






He that generates and augments the vegetation
and generates the waters and the power that orders and
rules over the entire moving universe may, we pray, give
us three fold health and peace of body, mind and soul
and bless us with threefold shelter against heat, cold
and rain, and give us threefold light of earth, heaven
and the middle regions for our well being all round.






By virtue of you the heifer becomes fertilized,
from you this soul assumes the body form it takes
according to its latencies, the mother receives the shower
of fertility from the father, by which, again, the father
receives extension of the self and the off spring grows
in body.

(past), kriyamana (present) and prarabdha (conditional)
rule the soul, and in whom three body-forms of the soul,

with energy and shower the honey sweets of pleasure,
enlightenment and the ecstasy of ananda upon the soul
in abundance: that is the ultimate cloud from whom life

from the heart, in honour of the self - refulgent sovereign
cloud, lord infinite, supreme source of life, may the lord

MANDAL - 7/ SUKTA - 102 353


Parjanya, the cloud that gives us showers of life and
joy. It is the child of light and saviour of the brilliant.
May the cloud, that bearer and harbinger of life and
joy, give us lovely food for body, mind and soul.






Celebrate the Parjanya, cloud of the showers of
life and existence, who generates the Golden Egg,
Hiranyagarbha, the seed of moving stars and revolving
planets, herbs and trees, cows and horses and the
humans, and the cloud which then brings the showers
of living waters and vests the seeds of life in earth for
vegetation and all that moves and achieves and all the
human race for the continuance of life in existence.






To him, the omnipotent omnificent Parjanya, life
bearing cloud, offer the sweetest oblations into the fiery
mouth of the yajna vedi with selfless surrender of love
and non-violence so that he may keep and help us keep
the unity and integrity of the earth and environment well
in order and maintain the integrity and harmony of
humanity and culture in a state of creativity and
progressive continuity of a familial order.






Mandukah (Parjanya) Devata, Vasishtha
Maitravaruni Rshi






Devoted Brahmanas dedicated to Brahma,
supreme spirit of the universe, observing the sacred
vows of discipline in silence for a yearly session,
spontaneously burst into the chant of divine hymns,
inspired by the cloud of divine showers and celebrate
the divine spirit, the divine voice and the divine shower
with enthusiasm.






When the heavenly waters shower upon these
celebrants, like rain on frogs who have been hybernating
in a dry pond like empty leather bags, they revive with
exhilaration, they burst into chant, and the chant of these
celebrants seems like the eager lowing of mother cows
for their calves or like the excitement of the heart on
the reflection of a new revelation on the imagination.




MANDAL - 7/ SUKTA - 103 355




And when the rainy season has set in, then, if
the cloud showers rain upon these longing celebrants
of life, thirsting for the divine waters of life, one goes
to meet another, chanting and shouting hilariously like
the child going to meet the father.




4. Anyo anyamanu grbhnatyenorapam prasarge


On the fall of divine showers they seize upon
each other while both experience the ecstasy of meeting
and the rain. When the celebrant is soaked in the rain,
the spotted versatile one springs forward and
communicates with the green one in concentration in
the language of intimacy.






When one of these speaks to the other, they seem
to repeat each other’s language like pupils repeating
the words of the teacher. While communicating like this
they jump and play on the water, their bodies swell with


joy and the pride of being.




6. Gomayureko ajamayurekah prsnireko harita eka


One of them croaks like a cow, another like a
goat, one of them is spotted, another is green. Of
different voice and colour, they bear the same one name,
the “manduka”, the celebrant, but they seem to
communicate in many different languages.






O Brahmanas, devotees of supreme Brahman,
at the end of the annual session when the last night is
over, then, at the time before dawn, abide as in
meditation and yajnic celebration just like the frogs who
play, rejoice and celebrate around the overflowing lake
when the showers of the season begin.



8. Brahmanasah somino vacamakrata brahma




MANDAL - 7/ SUKTA - 103 357


Brahmanas engaged in the yearly soma yajna
for peace and harmony conduct the yajna in honour of
the Supreme Brahman and chant the Vedic mantras at
the end of the first year. The priests facing the fire and
soaked in sweat emerge as if from seclusion in the cave.






These Brahmanas, leading lights of the yajnic
by the divinely ordained twelve month seasons and the
discipline and observances prescribed. At the end of
the year when the rains set in they emerge seasoned
and tempered in the heat of yajnic fire and attain their




10. Gomayuradadajamayuradat prsniradaddharito


All those that speak and sound like nature in
motion give us something; all those that speak and sound
like nature and spirit unborn and eternal give us
something; all those that speak and sound like the
spectrum of colours in various forms give us something;
all those that speak and sound like the dark and green
in life and nature give us something: all these give us




wealths of the world. Indeed all that speak and sound
and celebrate nature and the eternal spirit of nature give
us hundreds of wealths and values of existence on the
move, advance us and give us full health and age in the
thousandfold business of creative living and lead us to
fulfilment and ultimate freedom. (Such is the gift of
nature in the rainy season.)

fact: wee




Indra-Soma, O lord and commander of power,
peace and justice, O lord and master keeper of love,
peace and harmony, subject the evil and wicked to the
heat of discipline and correction or punish and reduce
them to nullity. O generous and virile lord and ruler, let
not the forces of darkness grow, keep them down, let
not the misguided rise and spread out, shut these down
and far off. Let the hoarders, grabbers, ogres and
devourers be subjected to law and punishment, destroy
the exploiters, stop them and let their fangs be blunted
and rooted out.


MANDAL - 7 / SUKTA - 104 359




2. Indrasoma samaghasamsam-abhygham tapur-
kimidine.


Indra-Soma, lord and master of peace and
power, love and justice, let the sinner and the criminal,
the supporter and admirer of sin and crime along with
the sin and crime, and the tormentor of the good and
innocent go to the fire of discipline, punishment, or
elimination like a handful of dirt meant for the fire.
Never compromise with the enemy of nature, divinity,
humanity and the wisdom of humanity. Rule out the
cannibal and the carrion eater, the man of hate and evil
eye, the sceptic, the cynic and the negationist. For them,
have the disdain they deserve and either correct them




acchavah.


Indra-Soma, fix the evil doer and throw him into
a deep dungeon of darkness without remission so that
by reason of that punishment no one again may raise




his head for evil doing. That power of yours full of
patience, fortitude and courage, that righteous passion
of yours be for the destruction of evil and sabotage
against life and social harmony.




4. Indrasoma vartayatam divo vadham sam prthivya


Indra-Soma, from heaven and earth, from
thunder and lightning and the showers of clouds, from
the light of idealism, love and generosity and down to
earth realism, bring unfailing laws of punishment and
correction against sin and crime, acts and policies
against poverty, disease, unemployment and wilful sloth,
and against the supporters of sin and crime as well as
against compromisers with negativities and negationists
of evil. Enact law of incentive and encouragement for
the generous, and blazing prohibitions for the
adamantine evil so that you nip and burn off rising crime
and evil in the bud.







MANDAL - 7 / SUKTA - 104 361


Indra-Soma, lord of power and force, lord of
peace and harmony, turn all round, revolve your search
lights and from the skies shoot out your weapons of
defence and offence, and with fiery, thunder-tipped,
fatally destructive, irresistible and inviolable weapons
fix the voracious ogres, strike them on the precipice
and throw them into the abyss, running off into silence
and oblivion without uttering a sigh of pain or voice of




6. Indrasoma pari vam bhitu visvata iyam matih


Indra-Soma, leading powers of governance and
peace, like mighty forces in harness ruling the nation,
may this prayer of mine, which, with the best of my
intention and understanding I address to you as an
exhortation, reach you and inspire you and guide you
all round, and may you, like the protector and ruler of
the nation as you are, make these words of prayer,
exhortation and adoration fruitful.



7. Prati smaretham tujayabdhir-evairhatam druho






And remember, be watchful and alert against
the malignant, evil and treacherous forces, ward them
off and eliminate them with the fastest interceptors and
destroyers at the very outset. Indra-Soma, let there be
no peace, nothing easy, for the evil doer whoever any
time may try to injure, sabotage or enslave us out of




8. Yo ma pakena manasa carantam-abhicaste


And while I live and act and behave with a

ruler and law giver of power, let him be reduced to






O Soma, lord of peace and justice, if there are
those who with their smartness and fast actions malign,
lacerate and deprive the man of purity, truth and
immaculate honour and spotless reputation, or with their
powers and prestige denigrate the man of goodness and
charitable action and bring disgrace upon him, deliver


MANDAL - 7 / SUKTA - 104 363


such men to the sufferance of darkness and the pain of
remorse or let them suffer the fangs of deprivation




10. Yo no rasam dipsati pitvo agne yo aSvanam yo


Whoever pollutes the flavour, taste and vitality
of our food and injures or impairs the vigour and power
of our horses, cows and our bodies, let such an enemy,
the thief, the robber and saboteur, O lord of light and
vitality, Agni, be reduced to nullity and himself suffer
debility of body and even deprivation from self-
extension and further growth.




11. Parah so astu tanva tana ca tisrah prthiviradho


O divinities of nature and humanity, he who
wants to injure and destroy us in the day and in the
night, must stay far off by his personal presence and
also by the progeny of his evil tendencies and even fall
lower than all the three orders of earthly existence, i.e.,
lower far than the good, the bad and the indifferent. His
honour and reputation would dry up and evaporate to




zero and there would be none even to remember him
after. Let it be so with such a person.




12. Suvijnanam cikituse janadya saccasacca vacast


Words of truth and words of untruth rival and
contend with each other. Of these, the one that is true to
the extent it is true and that which is simple and natural,
this Soma, lord of peace, harmony and the goodness of
life, preserves and protects, and the untrue, he destroys.
This simple and straight natural knowledge, the lord
reveals for the man who has the desire and ambition to
know the truth and reality of life.






Soma, lord of truth, peace and harmony, does
not call forth the crooked to the distinction between
truth and untruth, nor does he impel the selfish kshatriya,
ruler administrator, who parades his power and valour
in a false manner, nor does he incite the two toward the
untrue. But he does destroy the evil and the wicked and
also the one who speaks the untruth, since both the evil
and the liar end up in the bonds of Indra, lord of justice
and power.


MANDAL - 7/ SUKTA - 104 365






If I were a worshipper of falsehood as my divine
ideal, or if I adore the lord and divinities falsely,
deceiving them as if, then O lord of light and truth, Agni,
you would be angry with me. But I have not been thus,
then why would you, knowing everything born in
existence, feel angry with us? Not at all, because only
the speakers of falsehood would suffer your wrath and




15. Adya muriya yadi yatudhano asmi yadi vayusta-


If I were a demon on the move, and if I
tormented any person in life, then let me suffer death
today just now. But I am not such, nor have I done so.
Then let that man be forsaken of all his ten faculties of
power and prana who falsely proclaims that I am a
demonic tormentor of others.






16. Yo mayatum yatudhanetyaha yo va raksah


Whoever says that I am a devil even though I
am not a devil, and whoever says that he is innocent
and immaculate even though he is a devil, may Indra,
lord of power and justice, punish such a person with
his mighty thunderbolt. May such a falsifier fall to the
abyss as the worst of all living beings.




17. Pra ya jigati khargaleva naktamapa druha


And she that goes about at night, hiding her
person like the spirit of hate and violence, a she owl as
if, let her fall into the bottomless deep of darkness where
the stones of evil and darkness itself would destroy her
with a clang.



18. Vi tisthadhvam maruto viksvicchata grbhayata




O Maruts, vibrant social powers of vigilance and
action, stay among the people, keenly watch for the

production and advancement.

mighty powerful just like what the axe is for the wood,
breaking down the evil and wicked destroyers like pots
of clay whenever they raise their head.




22. Ulukayatum susulukayatum jahi Ssvayatumuta


Indra, refulgent and potent ruler of the world,
crush the evil and the wicked like pieces of clay with a
stone: the fiend in the garb of an owl or an owlet or a
dog or a wolf or a hawk or a vulture. They are covert,
stealthy, clever, jealous and growling, cruel destroyers,
cunning and voracious.

in courtesy, in chivalry, or at least in practical wisdom.
Arrogance, pride, anger, passion, all this on either’s part
must be subjected to reason and respectful cooperation

Six organs of perception in this body system,


MANDAL - 8/ SUKTA - 69 819


sophisticated and pervaded by Indra, the soul, with a

working of the system in divine service.





In the midst of these simple and straight organs
of sense, fast but well steered, there is one which is
extremely generous and creative, the intelligence, which
holds the whip and the reins both, that is, the acceleration
and the steer and the brakes for proper movement of
the systemic chariot.

O brotherly team of dynamic workers and

versatile creative intellect for the advancement of your
science of yajna for further development.




0. Nadam va odatinam nadam yoyuvatinam.


Indra is the resounding source of fresh energies,
roaring expression of maiden youthfulness, protector
and promoter of sacred sources of production and
nourishment such as cows which must not be killed or
hurt, and he is the relentless inexhaustible keeper of
your arrows for your targets of defence and






Just as on the rise of dawn in the divine heaven
of light, the edifying rays of the sun beatify the Indra-
born beauty and freshness of life in the three regions of
earth, heaven and the skies, similarly, on the dawn of
divine vision in the intelligence of the soul, the


MANDAL - 8/ SUKTA - 69 821

of the soma gifts of Indra, this oceanic source of matter,
energy and excellence of life, for the trinity of body,
mind and soul.



4. Abhi pra gopatim girendramarca yatha vide.


To the best of your knowledge and culture and
with the best of your language, worship and adore Indra,
protector of stars and planets, lands and cows, language

on to our sacred grass where we humans meet and pray
and celebrate the lord in song together.




6. Indraya gava asiram duduhre vajrine madhu.


Lands and cows, suns and planets, indeed all




objects in motion, exude for Indra, wielder of thunder,
the ichor of emotional adoration seasoned with ecstasy
like honey sweet milk mixed with soma which he
receives close at hand and cherishes.






Up let us rise on top of the sun and vast spaces,
reach the abode of Indra, and, having drunk the soma
sweet of ecstasy, let us be together across and over the
thrice seven stages of being in evolution in the purely
spiritual state of the lord’s presence as a friend.


(The thrice seven are the steps of physical,
mental and pychic evolutionary phases of existence in
three qualitative modes of being in the process of
becoming. The seven states of evolution in descending
order from pure being are: mahat, Ahankara and the
five elements, akasha, vayu, agni, apah and prthivi. The
three qualitative modes are sattva, rajas and tamas or
thought, energy and matter. Another way to explain the
perceptive organs and five organs of volition, the
twenty-first is antahkarana or psychic self. When the
psychic self or the soul in the existential state wishes to
rise back to the purely spiritual state, it has to cross the
twenty one stages and then be in the company of Indra,
the cosmic self, and even later, in the transcendental
state of absolute Being, the Spirit, the Brahmic state.


MANDAL - 8/ SUKTA - 69 823


This is set out it detail in the Sankhya, Yoga and Vedanta

communion with the divine, adore and worship Indra,
adore and worship again, worship again and again.
Worship along with your children and grand children,

glorious ruler of the celestial city.





The drum booms aloud, the bow string strikes
the arm guard, the string bells jingle, let the hymns rise
in honour of Indra.



10. A yat patantyenyah sudugha anapasphurah.


When the dynamic senses of perception and
volition, controlled, unagitating and calmly withdrawn,
concentrate in the inner mind, then you receive the
showers of soma nectar of spiritual ananda for Indra,


the soul.




11. Apddindro apddagnir-visve deva amatsata.

Indra, the soul, seeking honour, fame and power,
loves the soma of ananda. Agni, leading scholar
advancing into the light of knowledge, loves the soma
of ananda. All brilliancies of nature and humanity love
the ecstasy of soma. Varuna, powers of love and justice,
all abide in the ecstasy of soma. All seekers of yajnic
action and divine dedication love the soma of spiritual
ananda of their creation like the mother loving her child.


12. Sudevo asi varuna yasya te sapta sindhavah.




Varuna, master scholar and teacher, you are
divinely brilliant and generous whose seven streams of
knowledge and wisdom flow forth in words from the
master’s voice to the seekers, like water flowing from a

That soul is Indra, man of self control and self


MANDAL - 8/ SUKTA - 69 825


power, who withdraws his scattered powers of senses
and mind, turns them inward and applies them into
meditation for the sake of generosity of the spirit, and
then as their patient master and leader, with the power
and grace of his self-possession, releases and relaxes
them in the state of peace. He is the sovereign soul.




14. Afidu sakra ohata indro visva ati dvisah.


Indra, the sovereign soul of self-power,
transcends all jealousy, malignity and enmity and, blest

Neither a child nor an adolescent, the man of
mature mind abiding in a healthy body practices
meditation and realises the great, supreme, omnipotent
cosmic soul of universal holy action for the
enlightenment of all about Mother Nature and the father
of creation.






16. A tu susipra dampate ratham tistha hiranya-yam.


O lord of golden grace, father and sustainer of
the house-hold of the universe, come and seat yourself
in the golden chariot of this human body and, together
as friends and companions, we shall ride this chariot of
heavenly light, thousand wheeled, invincible and
immaculate, moving on the road to peace and ultimate
good.




17. Tam ghemittha namasvina upa svarajam-asate.

Thus do yajnic and meditative souls holding
havis for homage adore and worship self-refulgent Indra
when, in order to realise the nature, character and
generosity, indeed the very presence of the lord, they
turn their self-controlled mind to the Divine Soul in
order to reach him.

Of these devotees of yajna and lovers of

tempestuous stars and planets, earths and heavens, all
in unison move in order and do homage in reverence,
such is Indra.

words of homage.

of Agni from the sun into threefold wealth of knowledge,
action and prayer committed and dedicated to divinity.

Just as Agni rising in threefold flames, white,
red and dark, comes at lightning speed to yajna with
youthful power and the priests anoint and serve it with
homage, so does the light of divinity with revelations
of sattva, rajas and tamas and the values of knowledge,
action and prayer, youthful, bright and vibrant, come to
the mind of the celebrant, and then the yajnic senses,

children move around attached with their mothers (each
with the one that is his, but all mothers are the same,
the one common Soul).




15. Upa srakvesu bapsatah krnvate dharunam divi.


Agni, receiving, kindling and consuming the
oblations in the flames, turns the havi into light in
heaven as offering in the cup of faith to Indra. (So does
the yogi turn his thoughts through contemplation into
light and joy in the higher personality to offer it as

O seekers of strength, power and progress in
life, offer worship and adoration in honour of Indra if it
is your faith in heart and soul that reality is the truth

should we adore and worship?

all round. I am the creator, I am the destroyer, I split
open the seed, I manifest the world forms and I break
them back beyond the form into the seed state.

thought and meditation and see me, the lone presence

of divinity, invitation to a higher life of cosmic vision.)

In the liquid vitalities of the body system
surrounded by living waters, the virile vitality of the

omniscience which, then, all living and seeing forms of

honoured, served and studied, may, we pray, come direct
to us and bless.

life, release the inhibited streams of life to flow freely,
and the floods of human potential may then, we pray,
flow abundantly in the blissful yajnic creation of Indra.

The creative soul, Soma, is born along with mind

sacred as it is.









Floods of river waters showered from the clouds
flow fast in their happy course down to the sea and mix
with the ocean. Like these, may our people, joyous with

Pavamana Soma Devata, Renu Vaishvamitra Rshi







Thrice seven cows, creative powers of natural
evolution, generate the milky strain of vitality added to
the evolving reality in the service of the creator Soma
in the cosmic yajna in absolute time and space, Soma
who also created four other beautiful orders of existence
for the glory and sanctity of existence which grows by
the laws of cosmic dynamics.


(The seven cows may be interpreted as the seven
evolutes of Prakrti: mahan, ahankara and five subtle
elements of ether or akasha, energy or vayu, fire or agni,
water or apah, and earth or prthivi. Three are orders of
sattva or thought, rajas or motion, and tamas or matter.
This makes the thrice seven, the four other beautiful
orders of existence may be interpreted as mana (mind),
and ahankara (I-sense or existential personality).
Another interpretation could be the four Vedas,
knowledge, the corresponding order of existence in
terms of awareness and expression.






He, loving, sharing and pervading the immortal
beauty of existence, orders and adorns both heaven and
earth with his art, intelligence and poetic sublimity, also
vesting the vapours of the middle regions with his might
and splendour. Those who know the reality of the lord’s


MANDAL - 9 / SUKTA - 70 215


creation alongwith his power, love and generosity really
know and share the bliss.






May those radiations of the light and power of
this divine Soma, spirit of bliss, free from mortality,
deception or unreality, by which the lord strengthens,
purifies and sanctifies acts and virtues both human and
natural, be in accord with life, human as well as of other
forms, and may humanity receive and internalise that
divine spirit of love, peace and refulgence with all their
thought, thoughtful action and meditation.

He, blissful and watchful guardian of humanity
both pious and impious, exalted by ten efficient senses

and immortal dharmic discipline of humanity, He




watches at first hand what people do in thought, word
and deed.






He, adorable and exalted, pervades and abides
in both heaven and earth and in the middle regions,
happy, blissful and generous with showers of joy for
humanity for their honour and exaltation, to help them

he warns men of negative understanding, even
commanding them like a warrior who wards off the evil
and finally destroys the forces of violence and

divinity and the prime paradisal agent of the good of
humanity, should love and worship that Soma for his








Mighty, virile and generous all-watching soma
spirit of divinity, sharpening its top powers of perfection
of good and elimination of evil, settles in the heart centre
of the man of holy action, vibrates and resounds, and
then the man’s perceptive and discriminative
intelligence becomes definitive, protective and creative,




8. Sucih pundnas-tanvam-arepasamavye harir-


Pure, purifying and sanctifying the holy man in
body, the protective and gracious Soma spirit of divinity
is enshrined on top of the holy man’s inviolable being,
loved and adored for the sake of the spirit of friendship,
veneration for judgement and vibrant enthusiasm for
life, and then honey sweets of triple powers for body,
mind and spirit are created by men of holy action.










O Soma spirit of life and divinity, virile and
generous, pure and purifying, favourite of divine hearts,
come for the service of the divine Lord and join the
soma yajna and the soma yajis. Take us across the evil
before its onslaught. After all, he alone can guide the
traveller asking for directions who knows the area on
earth and the field of life.




10. Hito na saptirabhi vajam-arsendrasyendo jatha-


Like a war horse directed to the field of battle,
come Indu, Soma spirit of peace, power and joyous
action, flow, enter and purify the spirit of Indra, man of
action and the social order. Like the mariner crossing
the sea by boat, advance, O scholar and warrior, fighting
on. Protect us, destroy the scandal mongers and take us
across the sea of life.

MANDAL - 9 / SUKTA - 71 219




The gift is given liberally, the mighty, Soma,
comes to the hall and presides, the wakeful protects
against the evil and the jealous, and the omnipotent
Soma, lord of peace and plenty, creates water vapours
as a pillar and cover between the green earth and heaven
of light and reveals the Vedas to sanctify and glorify

the purest sacred spirit of his ancestral tradition in action
and attains the perfect, unsullied and absolute fulfilment
of his earthly existence.









The soma spirit of life vibrates and sanctifies,
distilled and condensed by clouds, realised by sages,
shining in sun-rays and reflecting in meditative minds
of the yogis. Virile and generous, it waxes in strength,
showers with the cloud and inspires all with intelligence.
It rejoices, reaches all, makes everything possible, and
with the divine voice joins humanity, cleanses and
sanctifies, and blesses all in yajna and in their yajnic




4. Pari dyuksam sahasah parvatavrdham madhvah


Honey showers of peace, patience and fortitude

experience, retain and sanctify high moral and spiritual
values of prime importance with the highest reflections
of divinity.

5. Sami ratham na bhurijorahesata dasa svasaro


MANDAL - 9 / SUKTA - 71 221


Just as ten fingers of both hands control and
direct the chariot’s course so, if the ten faculties of
perception and volition and the ten pranas collected
together in meditation were to raise the yogi’s
intelligence and awareness and he were to rise as reborn
and reach the lap of mother Infinity, he would attain to
the top of the blissful stage of existence which all his
faculties in unison would generate for him.

As the eagle bird comes to rest in its nest, so

seat of sanctity the celebrants adore the dear Soul with
holy song where the divine Spirit, loving and adorable,
blesses the divine soul of the yogi and his transparent
faculties and rules as an emperor over the dominion.





The divine Soma Spirit of peace and power self-




refulgent beyond the lights of heaven, omniscient
creator, omnificent giver, visionary and watchful over
the three orders of time and space, delights in the songs
of adoration as a committed listener. It is omnipotent
guide over a thousand ways, immanent and
transcendent, and rules and illuminates the eternal dawns
of light and vision like the sun.




8. Tvesam rupam krnute varno asya sa yatrasayat


Its form assumes a lustrous character of blazing
refulgence, and wherever it reflects, shines and abides,
there in the battles of human life and existence it destroys
negativities and inner conflicts. Commanding the
dynamic powers of life with its innate potential it goes
to the pious celebrant and abides there in the heart
adored with the highest words of exaltation.






Just as cosmic energy comprehends and controls
all systems of the universe and with its thunderous
dynamics vests the sun with light, so does Soma,
supreme spirit of creativity, peace and joy, the light of


MANDAL - 9 / SUKTA - 72 223


life and cosmic intelligence, watches the earth and nature
and, with its holy creativity, controls and enlightens all
systems and species it has created.

Devout celebrants love Soma divine like the
warmth of fire, admire it like beauty of the dawn, and
exalt it like light of the sun. You join the bliss of this
divinity with all your senses, mind, intelligence and
awareness. And then you would realise that Soma
vibrates in the heart as bliss and rolls as waves of the

thoughts and intellect, and sharpens the vision and
imagination. Indeed there are no bounds to the precious
gifts of Soma, infinite are they, universally adored and

Bearing love and enthusiasm for this Soma, the

Streams of the waves and particles of exuberant
soma of the creator singing in unison flow into forms
in the cosmic home of existence, and the centre-holds




of the forms of systems and sub-systems flow back into
the vedi of the cosmic yajna, completing the cycle. The
highest and omnipotent lord of cosmic vitality, to begin
this yajna, brought into manifestation three modes of
Prakrti, sattva, rajas and tamas, and the emergence of
living forms of species, boat-like carriers-on, finally
complete the holy creative process.






Mighty men, sages, scholars and leaders, wise,
ambitious and good intentioned, holily all together
stirring on top of the oceanic waves of existence, keep

doing good work in honour of the lord creator, advance

Men of soma purity of mind and character, they
stand by the holy voice of divinity and the dynamics of


MANDAL - 9 / SUKTA - 73 229

enveloping space alone can cover the mighty ocean and
the cosmic vapours, similarly men of stable mind only
can keep original human commitment in matters of






In this world of a thousand streams of soma joy
and divine generosity, the soma souls in humanity sing
and swim in action, sweet of tongue, mind and will,
joining the paradisal vision of heavenly light. The instant
and watchful eyes of the dynamics of divinity, all
enveloping and all beholding, are ever awake without a
wink for the moment. O lord, at every step the binding
bonds are there, and there are saviour bridges as well.






Like the rays of sunlight radiating from above
to mother earth in unison, shining with their brilliance,
illuminating and purifying, and burning off those




pollutants which act against natural law, the soma souls
of humanity acting in unison around father and mother
in holy tradition, shining and sanctifying life with divine
hymns, reducing and eliminating powers of negative
character and habit against natural law and human
values, they drive off and eliminate the defilers and
violators of cosmic law, and, with the knowledge and
power of the light of great heaven, they remove the veil
of the darkness of ignorance.

Soma souls that act in unison with faith in eternal
values, who are self-controlled by the divine Word and
follow the spirit of lord Almighty pursue the path of
universal law and reach the divine destination. But men
of negative disposition see not what they see and hear
not what they hear, abandon the path of truth and fail to
reach the divine destination of life.






In this expansive world of a thousand streams


MANDAL - 9 / SUKTA - 73 231


of purity flowing on and on, men of noble thought and
poetic vision create, speak and sanctify their word. Men
of judgement and rectitude, they discriminate between
right and wrong and the natural consequences thereof.
They are dynamic, free from jealousy, penetrative
observers, worthy of reverence, holy visionaries and
constant watchers of humanity




8. Rtasya gopa na dabhaya sukratustri sa pavitra


The man of universal truth, guardian of law, is
undaunted, he is not for fear, nor for deceit. Pure at
heart and holy of action, he maintains that strength and
purity in his threefold conduct in thought, word and
deed. Man of knowledge, vision and practical wisdom,
he overwatches the entire regions of the world, brings
to book the sceptics and the uncommitted, and fixes the
saboteurs and the violators of law.





The web of Truth and Law is vast and universal.
It extends enshrined in the pure at heart and speaks at




the tip of the tongue by virtue of the wondrous power
of Varuna, lord of love and justice, choice and
discrimination. The brave, settled at heart and mind,
receive it and follow it to self-fulfilment. The sceptics,
dissenting and denying, fall from grace into negation
and utter frustration.

MANDALA 10


Mandala 10/Sukta 1
Agni Devata, Trita Aptya Rshi





There on the eastern horizon, with the first lights
of the dawn emerging out of darkness, rises up the sun,
mighty Agni, great and glorious with radiant light, and
as it rises it covers and lights up all regions of the world.




2. Sa jato garbho asi rodasyoragne carurvibhrta


Agni, born of the womb of earth and heaven
covered in darkness over night, you are beautiful, lovely
as a child and wonderful, and as you rise over night and
darkness, you radiate your rays over mother heaven and
earth proclaiming them bright, and immediately you are
received and held over them in the herbs and trees for
life.








Omnipresent Agni, Vishnu, thus risen as the sun,
attains to its third and supreme state of the expansive
light of infinite divinity which it radiates, protects and
promotes. Those wide-awake sages who receive this
divine light energy through direct presence and
internalise it celebrate it in song and worship it as the
nectar gift of divinity here on earth.




4. Ata u tva pitubhrto janitrirannavrdham prati


And you, Agni, who bear and augment the food
for life, life creative and food productive agents of nature
and humanity, bearing food for you, serve you in
response to you, and as they feed you, you reach them
again while they are in different form, and thus you are
the leading power in the yajnic cycle of life among
nature and the human people and communities.


5. Hotaram citraratham-adhvarasya yajnasya-




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 1 427


Agni, high priest of all non-violent and
inviolable yajna, all creative and productive activity in
nature and humanity, moving forward by wondrous
beautiful chariot, blazing banner-bearer and pioneer of
progress, cyclic augmenter and promoter of every
brilliant and generous divinity in nature and humanity,
is loved, cherished and reverenced of humanity by virtue
of its divine grandeur, generosity and grace: this Agni
we worship and serve by yajna.

assuming different modes of form and function, holding

priest of cosmic yajna, ruling supreme, pray join all
divinities of nature and humanity, bring them here and

Mandala 10/Sukta 2
Agni Devata, Trita Aptya Rshi






all-reaching all pervasive power and presence, ordainer
and maintainer of the seasons of time and nature, fulfil
the loving and aspiring seekers, dedicated scholars and
divine powers, and be with energy they should have. O
self-refulgent divine energy, light and intelligence, of
all the divine powers and presences, stars and planets,
which together carry on the dynamics of cosmic yajna,
you are the closest, highest and most adorable power
worthy of attainment.




2. Vesi hotramuta potram jananam mandhatasi


Agni, you produce, procure, energise and


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 2 429


provide all yajnic inputs, refinements and purifying
agents of life for humanity at the individual and social
level for life’s maintenance and promotion. You are the
harbinger of intelligence and knowledge and giver of
wealth and honour, and you are the observer and
presiding power of holy rites, laws and seasons of time
and nature. We enact the yajna with holy inputs and
with truth and honey of thought, word and deed, and
pray may divine and adorable fire carry the fragrance
to the divinities for human fulfilment.






Let us follow the path of the divinities, sagely
scholars, stars and planets as far as we can and do that
in proper order so that we may be able to continue: Agni
knows, the scholar knows, the sun is the base of
knowledge in relation to its systemic position, that is
the high priest of the solar system, that controls the
harmonious movements of the planets, that ordains the
pattern of the seasons.


(Let the sun be the base of our knowledge of
the stars and planets in our pursuit of yajnic astronomy.
Similarly let the sagely scholar who knows the science
of yajna be our guide in our studies and our actions.)






4. Yadvo vayam praminama vratani vidusam deva


And if we, being ignorant and deficient, neglect
or transgress or overstep the laws and disciplines of
those who know, then, O divinities, Agni, the sun, the
sage, being abundant and graciously fulfilling, makes
all that up and saves us by those very powers and actions
in time and seasons by which it keeps the sages and
divinities in the systemic order.






And if we mortals, either because of immature
mind or poor faith and want of expertise, do not know
and do not understand and appreciate the way the divine
solar yajna is going on, even so Agni, the high priest of
that yajna, knowing, ordering and conducting that yajna,
the most adorable pervasive all reaching partner, carries
on the yajna of heavenly bodies in order according to
the time and seasons.




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 2 431


6. Visvesam hyadhvaranamanikam citram ketum


The creator of all the stars and planets of the
universe moving in their orbits created you too, O Agni,
O sun, wonderful pioneer and commander of the solar

blest with noble people, and bring us cherished foods,
energies and knowledges, and let there be showers of
rain giving us abundance of food and fertility for the
life species of the world.




7. Yam tva dyavaprthivi yam tvapas-tvasta yam tva


O Agni, you whom the heavens bear as sun and
light, the middle regions bear as wind and electricity,
and the earth bears as fire and magnetic energy, whom
Tvashta, cosmic maker of all forms of existence,
fashioned forth and brought into existence, you, O Agni,
O Sun, knower of the paths of father Time and mother
Niyati, cosmic intelligence, and of the Karma and fate
of ancestors, children of time, you, lighted in the vedi
and blazing in the heavens, pray shine on us and
illuminate the paths of life for us.

rusatimapajan.


illuminator of heaven and earth, blazing and
commanding terrible power, abundant with life giving
energy, is seen on high, energising life for intelligent
and industrious work on earth and shining with
boundless light, and then relinquishing the day light
and projecting the light far away ahead, passes on to
the area of erstwhile darkness of the night. (Then night
follows the day here and the day follows night there.)






Then again, overcoming the dark passage of the
night with its illumination of light and manifesting the
youthful daughter of great and vast heaven bearing the
light of the sun up above, the same Agni shines with
heavenly light constantly for the day.




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 3 433




The sun of auspicious light, dispeller of darkness
of the night, has come up close at the heels of its love,
the beauteous holy dawn now on the run on its own and
thus Agni, prevailing with beautiful sun shine of the
morning holds off the darkness for the day.




4. Asya yamaso brhato na vagnun-indhana agneh


The mighty floods of the solar light version of
this Agni, bursting forth like thunderous explosions of
the voice of kindly, friendly, adorable, potent and
sublime power, are fair and blissful reflections of the
eternal Spirit, the Purusha, for the man of vision and
knowledge on way to divinity.






Agni, beauteous and blissful, mighty and
sublime presence whose brilliant rays and reflections




radiate, resound and flow like roaring winds and
thunderous lightning illumines the heavens with its
highest lustre and with its sportive and most potent
splendours reaches the summit of refulgent space.




6. Asya Susmaso dadrsanapaver-jehamanasya
devatamo vi rebhadbhir-aratir-bhati vibhva.


The mighty radiations of this solar Agni,
universally vibrant and armed with thunder, roar with
the winds while this divinest and most refulgent
universal presence pervades and relentlessly energises
the universe with its eternal, brilliant and resounding
reflections and vibrations.






Agni, bring us great wealth, honour and light
of the world. Be with us on the yajna vedi, being radiant,
vibrant and ever on the move between the joint world
of heaven and earth. Agni, commanding light,
illumination and instant motion, eloquent by expression,
come by the waves of energy with the voice of thunder,
come and bless us here on the vedi.

Mandala 10/Sukta 4
Agni Devata, Trita Aptya Rshi






Agni, eternal, self-refulgent and universal spirit
of light, I join you in yajnic self surrender, I send up my
thoughts and prayers to you so that you may be always
with us, adorable and present, in our yajnas and joint
battles of life. Just as rain is the shower of bliss in the
desert, so you are the giver of fulfilment to the yajnic
celebrant and the needy supplicant.






To you, most youthful Agni, people move and
they join you for bliss as cows move to the warm stall
to escape the cold outside. You are the saviour and
vibrant presence at the heart of divinities and mortal
humanity, and by your radiant presence and grandeur
you exist and vibrate in every thing.








loving it and raising it, so does mother earth hold and
bear you, victorious, as fire and magnetic energy,
augmenting you and loving to be with you, and you,
radiating through the middle space, rush down, loving
and ambitious to win and excel, like a captive animal




4. Mura amura na vayam cikitvo mahitvamagne


O wise one, enlightened presence, light and fire
of knowledge and energy, we are ignorant, but you know
and bear your grandeur, dear loving Agni. You pervade,
vibrate and radiate, lying immanent in various forms,
touch, lick and consume with your flames and rays
various assimilative forms of existence, being master
of the world.







MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 4 437


Somewhere it arises and manifests in old and
dried woods with the banner of smoke or streak of a
falling star in dead worlds. New, adorable as well as
ancient bright, it abides unattached in floods of water
and vibrates and radiates in vapours and clouds like a
mighty force of energy which intelligent knowledgeable
people visualise, realise and generate in various ways
for various uses and purposes.




6. Tanutyajeva taskara vanargu rasanabhirdasa-


Like dedicated self-insulated researchers in
pursuit of light and energy scholars study Agni with the
application of light rays and ten senses and pranas and
then say: this is the latest new knowledge about you,
Agni, pray come and join us as a new chariot of
achievement with brilliant rays of power for energy.






O Agni, all pervasive, all knowing and born
anew, this voice of knowledge, this offering is homage
and this song of adoration may ever be progressive and
rising for us. Pray protect and promote our children,




protect our grand children, and protect and watchfully
guard our body and mind without relent.


Mandala 10/Sukta 5
Agni Devata, Trita Aptya Rshi






The one deep oceanic treasure hold of all world’s
wealth, manifestive in many ways, Agni inspires and
expands our hearts with light and generosity, fills the
middle space between heaven and earth with vapours
of the cloud, and abides at the hidden centre of the
mystery deep in the cloud.






Great, generous, animated and impregnated
forces such as clouds, bearing the same one inner law
and spirit of Agni, join with impetuously fast moving
forces and, open ended, vibrant, expressive and
expansive, observe the universal dynamics of the law,
and at their centre continue to bear many other forms
and forces of water and energy yet to develop and act
further in evolution.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 5 439





The forces of law and change and the forces of
form and intelligence evolving things together in
measure of form and time create every new form as a
lovely baby and thus, with the mind of the cosmic seer,
designer and maker, extend the genetic thread of Agni,
the centre seed and centre hold of the entire world of
moving and non-moving versions of cosmic reality.




4. Rtasya hi vartanayah sujatamiso vajaya pradivah


Visionary scholars who know the paths of law
and change in evolution study and apply the versions
of Agni evolved and developed in latest form for the
achievement of new and extended food, energy and
knowledge of reality which heaven and earth both
sustaining all forms of life feed for extension with inputs
and refinements of the honey sweets of water and energy.








The sun rising and illuminating the world
radiates seven rays of bright light and raises them from
the honey sweets of mists of the morning in order to
illuminate the world for all to see. The sun, of ancient
and eternal birth, radiates them across the middle regions
and, with love for the earth, shines over, meets and
energises the nutritious forms of things on earth.




6. Sapta maryadah kavayas-tataksus-tasame-


Seven are the bounds between good behaviour
and evil set up by the wise. If one violates even one of
them, he is a sinner. Agni is the pillar and centre hold of
humanity. At the end of the journey, one, who in life
has observed these bounds, reaches and rests in the
shelter of the highest and closest, Agni, and abides in
the highest states of being.







Being and Becoming, constant and mutable,
both in the Supreme Absolute mystery, then the seed of
perfect existence in the womb of Mother Nature, and




then Agni, self-manifested at the earliest stage of
creative evolution, all this, our father and mother as one,
was in the ultimate infinite mystery of Brahma, -the
Supreme Reality, the Absolute Soul, One with its own

This is that Agni under whose shelter with all
protection the celebrant rises towards the attainment of
total fulfilment and who, self-refulgent and gracious,
infinitely abundant, transcends all with the highest and
most blazing lights of divinity.




2. Yo bhanubhir-vibhava vibhatyagnir-devebhir-


Agni who, self-refulgent and gracious, shines
along with the light of divinities and light of cosmic
stars, keeps the eternal laws and values of life and nature,
and who, ever true, inviolable and unviolated, goes on
with love and friendship with the friends and celebrants
of divinity like energy itself, constantly.








Agni who rules over all the divine bliss and
yajnic gifts of the world, who, life of the world, is the

and inspires the divinities at the earliest and fastest.
Charming and adorable, holy receiver and liberal giver,
most highly worshipped with heart and soul, universally
immanent and pervasive, Agni blesses the sages with
divine gifts of holiness and grace.








That Agni, giver of prosperity, shining and
radiating like light energy, you should study, realise and

offerings. Agni, universally immanent and wakeful giver
of strength and power, sages and scholars study and
exalt with high words and application of mind and

all wealth, honours and excellences of the world
concentrate like stormy war horses in close formation
by swift movements and converge in battle victory, pray
create and bring us the latest, fastest and most powerful
means of defence, protection and advancement.

Agni (1-6), Indra (7-9) Devata, Trishira Tvashtra Rshi






Agni, mighty abundant power and presence,
goes forward with lofty lightning force and banner
roaring over heaven and earth. It goes to the very heights
and bounds of heaven in all directions and sub-directions
and pervades in the middle regions in the depth of
vapours and the mighty one grows mightier there at the
heart of clouds.


vatsah simivan aravit. Sa devatatyudyatani




Agni waxes with joyous energy, all pervasive
and comprehending, mighty abundant, virile and
invigorating, lovely as a child yet perfect and powerful
as accomplisher, and expresses itself loud and bold from
silence of the night to roar of the winds and thunder of
the clouds. Thus does Agni go on, the quintessence of
divine powers, raising and energising all presences, as
the prime power and presence in its own universal
dwellings over and across spaces (as agni, fire and
magnetic force on earth, as vayu, electric energy in the
middle regions, and as aditya, light in the high heavenly






In the cosmic yajna of motherly earth and

forms of existence join its bright flames and radiations
and benefit from it.




4. Usauso hi vaso agramesi tvam yamayorabhavo


MANDAL - 10/SUKTA - 8 449


Agni, Vasu, sustainer of life, generating the sun
for the manifestation of your self, you rise first with
every dawn, illuminate the day and distinguish both day
and night, and for conduct of the yajna of existence you
bear the seven flames of fire and seven rays of light.






You are the eye and guardian of the mighty
yajnic order of the cosmos, and when you proceed for
the dynamics of the order you become the great
evolutionary force of the process of formative evolution.
You are the omnipresent power that sustain the waters
and energies of the cosmic evolution against devolution,
and you are the inspirer and promoter of the yajamana
who offers you the holy inputs of the evolutionary
yajaka.




6. Bhuvo yajnasya rajasasca neta yatra niyudbhih


Agni, you are the leader and carrier of yajnic
energies and energiser of the regions through which the
energies rise and radiate, where you join and conduct
the holy waves of energy onward. In the regions of light
you sustain the blissful sun high and on the earth you




enjoin your flames of fire to carry the fragrance up and
around for the world.






Trita, the human soul, wearing three body covers
of gross, subtle and causal forms in earthly existence,
with the desire to win the love of this supreme paternal
divinity by concentrative meditation, chooses to
meditate on divinity within the self and, thus nestled in
the parental presence praying as a child for protection,
obtains the arms for defence against internal and external
onslaughts of material involvement.




8. Sa pitryanyayudhani vidvanindresita aptyo


That divinely self-realised soul, having got the
paternal arms of defence and inspired by Indra,

adversaries and, having controlled and subdued the three
headed seven bridled bondage of sense and mind, gets
free of the bonds.

Mandala 10/Sukta 10


Devata: Yama Vaivasvata (1, 3, 5-7, 17, 13) and Yami
Vaivasvati (2, 4, 8-10, 12, 14) Rshi: Yami Vaivasvati (1, 3,
5-7, 11, 13) and Yama Vaivasvata (2, 4, 8-10, 12, 14)


This sukta is a beautiful poem in the form of a
dialogue between Yama, the bright day, and Yami, the
dark night. They are children of Vivasvan, the sun. The
theme is desire of the night to commingle with the day,
which is not possible as long as the earth rotates and
revolves round the sun and the world continues to exist
as itis. Yama and Yami can commingle only when all
this variety of existence goes back into the unity of
absolute essence beyond physicality. The dialogue thus
is a nature myth which borders on the mysterious


Yama and Yami are treated as human characters.
For this reason certain commentators as Sayana and
others who follow Sayana and popular mythology
interpret Yama and Yami as twin brother and sister. The
theme then is reduced to a story of incestuous love
unfulfilled. This interpretation is not correct because if
Yama and Yami were brother and sister, the name of the
sister would be Yama ending with long a, and not Yami.
Yami can be the name of the female partner of a wedded
couple (Panini, 1, 4, 48) and not of a twin sister. They
are interpreted here as complementarities.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 10 455


It may be further suggested here that Yama and
Yami on the human plane need not necessarily be
be interpreted as two close friends in love, Yami
proposing and soliciting the love of Yama and Yama
replying that the love possibly cannot be consummated
because the day and night can never meet except at that
point of time where meeting and parting are identical
and simultaneous. And whenever the meeting would
be possible in remote future, at pralaya, the time of


and Yami as twins they should be interpreted as the male
and the female complementary forms of the same one
human species, children of the same one creator,
Vivasvana, in which case the question of incest between
brother and sister does not arise.)






Yami: With love and desire I come to my friend
of my own choice, a friend who has crossed the vast
ocean of life a long long way, and I solicit and pray that
knowing and thinking of your fulfilment of familial
obligation on earth, you beget a successor saviour of
your father’s familial line and (in marriage) bless me
with a child.






2. Na te sakha sakhyam vastyetat salaksma yadvisu-


Yama: Your friend accepts not your proposal of
love, friendship and union since you are not
homogeneous with him in character and versatility of
merit and maturity, in fact you are the contrary. Indeed
the brave progeny of the great lord of life and energy of
nature, refulgent with light and wisdom, who maintain
the light of heaven along with the earth take exception
to such a proposal of union, in fact they watch, wonder
and rule out such a proposal for union.





Yami: The immortal sustainers of earth and
heaven do wish that every mortal should leave at least
one descendant child. I have accepted your mind and
soul as one with me, so pray come and join me in body
as life giver husband of your child.




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 10 457


4. Na yat pura cakrma kaddha nunamrta vadanto


Yama: Having observed the laws of divine
nature and observing them now, what we have never
done before how can we do now in violation of the truth
and law? Gandharva, the sun, sustainer of the earth, is
there in the middle region, the moon too is there, so are
you, youthful night, as I am. But the earth is the common
axis between you and me both, and that is the extreme
opposition between you and me. (We cannot possibly
meet while the earth is in orbit.)






Yami: Our generator Savita, creator of the
universe, Tvashta, maker of forms and Kah, sustainer
of created forms, made us a couple in nature’s womb of
generation itself as keepers of this earthly home. None
can now violate the rules of the lord’s discipline, they
don’t. Mother earth and father heavenly sun know of
this complementarity of ours.






6. Ko asya veda prathamasyahnah ka im dadarsa


Who knows of this complementarity created at
the dawn of creation? He alone knows. As of now, who
witnessed it? Who can vouchsafe it now? Vast is the
distance between east, the house of Mitra, sun and the
day, and west, house of Varuna, presiding deity of the
night. O wanton dear, having seen the people now, who




7. Yamasya ma yamyam kama agantsamane yonau


I, the night, feel stricken with desire to share
life with you, Yama, in one house and one bed and wish
I should surrender my body as a wife does to the husband
so that we may carry on the business of life like the two
wheels of a chariot.




8. Na tisthanti na ni misantyete devanam spaSa tha


Yama: These watchful lights of divinities which
sojourn here around in space neither stop nor deviate
from their path, nor do they wink their eye. O love-lorn
maiden, go soon to one of these, other than me and with


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 10 459


him carry on the business of life like a chariot wheel.






If for a moment the lord of existence were to
reduce the earth to the axis and its centre point and the
light of the sun were exhausted along with days and
nights, then like heaven and earth together we too may
be together and the night may enjoy conjugal union with
the day without any obstruction




10. A gha ta gacchanuttara yugani yatra jamayah

ages hence when contraries would lie together and
coexist without contradictions. Therefore for the time,
O sweet and debonair, extend your hand of love to

to me? And I, deprived of love and care, become a sister,
bereft, going away elsewhere in search of another?
with body. (Are you just a complementary support and




12. Nava u te tanva tanvam sam paprcyam papa-


Yama: No, I would never touch your body with
my body. The wise say that to go and meet a sister like
that is a sin, to meet a corresponding way farer in orbit
is a violation of the law of nature. O dear and fortunate
one, go, be happy with another other than me and make
it possible if you can. Your brother way farer does not
love this proposal, no he cannot.




13. Bato batasi yama naiva te mano hrdayam cavi-


Yami: Sorry Yama, O day, it is a pity I did not
know your mind and heart this way of nature. May be
some one other than me too may join you like a girdle
round your waist and embrace you like a creeper
clinging by a tree.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 11 461




14. Anyamu su tvam yamyanya u tvam pari svajate


Yama: Some other may embrace you too and
you embrace him like a creeper by the tree. Love you
the other man and his heart, may he too love you and
yours. Thus may you create and achieve a happy union
in love and good fortune.


Mandala 10/Sukta 11
Agni Devata, Angi Havirdhana Rshi





Generous, omnipotent and indomitable Agni,
self-refulgent ruling Spirit of life in the systemic order
of existence, with its natural art and intelligence and
creativity, creates and showers the waters of growth and
sustenance from the divine infinity of inexhaustible
plenty of light, life and joy for the yajnic and generous
powers of nature and humanity. The Spirit is Varuna,
omniscient intelligence with universal discrimination,
knowing the world as it is and the way it behaves. May
the lovable and adorable Agni worshipped at yajna love,




join and bless the yajnic celebrants of life divine
according to the seasons and its own love and




2. Rapadgandharvirapya ca yosana nadasya nade


May the spirit and power of Agni blazing in the
sun, thundering in the clouds, vibrating in vapours,
flashing in lightning, burning in the vedi and roaring in
rivers, protect, promote and inspire my mind. May
imperishable Infinity, indomitable nature and inviolable
policy establish us all at the heart of what we love to
do, accomplish and worship in life and society, and may
our chief, eldest, supportive and sustaining brother,
speak to us and enlighten us in matters of Dharma, artha,
kama and moksha.






Instantly does that blessed, blissful, inspiring
and elevating dawn, light of life, vision of wisdom,
harbinger of honour, excellence and divine virtue, arise
and shine in response to dedicated action bearing the


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 11 463


bliss of heaven for all humanity when, in pursuit of
corporate creative living and search for total freedom,
people light the yajna fire for Agni, lover of the lovers
of divinity and chief high priest of the yajna of life.




4. Adha tyam drapsam vibhvam vicaksanam


When noble and dynamic people, lovers of life
dedicated to yajna fire, choose to worship the potent
and gracious Agni, chief of cosmic yajna and harbinger
of infinite gifts, then the celebrant soul of the individual,
or society or the ruler of the social order, with flying
super-intelligence inspired by the spirit of divinity,
achieves that same great and ecstatic power and
enlightenment of universal order both on earth and in
the spirit by social yajna and spiritual meditation, and
by that Agni itself, omniscient, omnipotent and
omnificent, becomes the inviolable foundation of human
karma, and all possible faculties of thought and action
arise for the achievement of success.









Agni, just as food is dear and auspicious to the
robust lover of health, so are you dear, exciting and
inspiring for humanity, being the holiest presiding power
of social and spiritual yajna served with hymns of
invocation and adoration, you who, pleased with the
sage’s songs of adoration, sharing and fulfilling the
yajnic homage of devotees, visit and bless the celebrants
with plenty and immensities of gifts of enlightenment




6. Udiraya pitara jara a bhagamiyaksati haryato


Agni, raise and augment the parental powers of
heaven and earth and extend the honour and excellence
of humanity there like the sun, stealer of the night, which
spreads its light in space. The yajamana performs yajna
in honour of the divinities of nature and humanity and
loves the divinities and yajna with his heart and soul.
The ruler, burden bearer of the life of humanity, is up
and active and adores and exalts you. The fire is rising
and blazing bright, the high priest is inspired, and the
life giving energies vibrate with action and intelligence.




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 11 465


7. Yaste agne sumatim marto aksat sahasah suno


Agni, creator and augmenter of power, patience
and fortitude, the mortal who reaches and internalises
your divine favour of knowledge and wisdom rises to
immortal honour and fame and, having abundant food,
energy and life’s graces of his choice and enjoying
equipment of horses and fast transport, rises in light,
lustre and splendour of life day by day.




8. Yadagna esa samitirbhavati devi devesu yajata


Adorable Agni, when this holy assembly of your
yajnic powers and virtues honoured among the divines
meets and, O lord self-refulgent and self-sufficient, you
distribute the jewels of life among them, then pray bless
us too with our share of the honour and excellence of
life.







Listen to our prayer, Agni, in this hall of yajna,
harness your chariot replete with the nectar of




immortality, bring us the wealth of earth and light of
heaven both divine, let none of the divinities forsake
us. Pray abide in our heart here and ever.


Mandala 10/Sukta 12
Agni Devata, Angi Havirdhana Rshi






Heaven and earth are the first and closest
divinities by virtue of the cosmic order to listen to the
holy chant and proclaim their response with light and
generosity, when Agni, refulgent spirit of life and light
of the world, chief priest and inspirer of cosmic yajna,
calling mortals to the altar, settles in the vedi itself
upfront, generating and accelerating the radiation of its
own energy in the yajnic process being enacted.






May Agni, supreme power and presence of the
spirit over divinites of heaven and earth, first and instant
cognizant of our invocation and prayers, radiate and


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 12 467


carry our homage and oblations to the divinities of
nature by the laws of its cosmic order, Agni, the power
with the banner of light and fragrance, blazing with the
flames of fuel fire, adorable sublime, divine call for
action and creative evolution, eternal and imperishable,
loving and companionable by words of sincere
adoration.






When the celestial nectar of this refulgent
power’s own essence radiates, then the energies
generated by it support and sustain both earth and
heaven, and all divinities of nature and humanity receive
and celebrate these gifts of Agni, the divine beauty,
radiance and liquid energies which the light divine




4. Arcami vam vardhayapo ghrtasnu dyavabhumi


Listen both heaven and earth my words of
adoration : I celebrate you both heaven and earth as
father and mother, givers of the liquid energies of life
for the growth and progress of humanity and the




environment, which, may the brilliant geniuses of
humanity, taking forward the energy projects and
policies of the world, promote day and night incessantly,
and which, may the parental powers and leadership of
mankind refine and augment to further the light and
sweetness of life here on earth.






Does the ruling and refulgent Agni receive and
and limits of benediction and experimentation? Who
knows this secret we ought to know? Agni after all is a
friend. Invoked and served with excess or remiss, it
would still accept our homage and adoration and convey
it to the divinities, and we pray let there be success and




6. Durmantvatramrtasya nama salaksma yadvi-


Incomprehensible is this mystery of immortal
Agni and its power, for sure, since arising from the same
one origin and being homogeneous, it grows to
boundless variety of forms, which, nevertheless, for the


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 12 469


man who knows the One Supreme, Agni, ordainer and
controller of this existential variety, is simple and clearly
understood. This man, O lord great and gracious, protect
and promote without relent.






In whose being the divinities of nature and
humanity rejoice in the yajnic order of existence, carry
on their assigned tasks in the regions of light and in the
heart and mind of humanity, and vest light in the sun
and the dark tinge in the moon, that self-refulgent Agni,
the sun and moon and all other divinities constantly
adore and serve.




8. Yasmin deva manmani samcarantyapicye na
vita devo varunaya vocat.


In whose illuminative yet mysterious being all
divine powers exist and act, we know not well. May the
same self refulgent Agni, the divine powers reveal to
us, simple, sincere and conscientious seekers of divinity,
so that we may distinctly and intelligently know and
serve the divine power. May Mitra, universal spirit of
refulgent Savita, the sun, reveal the mysterious power


and presence to us.






Listen to our invocation and exhortation, Agni,
in this spatial hall of cosmic yajna. Harness the chariot
replete with the nectar of immortality, bring us the
wealth of earth and light of heaven both divine. Let
none of the divinities forsake us. Pray abide in our heart
and soul here and for ever.

For you, O heaven and earth, men and women,

joy of yourselves and all of us and for self-fulfilment in

By the discipline of body mind and soul, I would
cover the five stages of earthly existence from the
vijnanamaya kosha to the anandamaya state of divine
joy. I would cover the four stages of brahmacharya,
grhastha, vanaprastha and sanyasa to total freedom. By
meditation on Aum I would cover the physical, psychic
and spiritual stages to the fourth stage of turiya, the




state of transcendent happiness. Thus would I reach and
abide in the centre of the divine order of existence in
the state of absolute purity of the spirit.

service and homage of yajna (if you wish to survive as

Note: In Surya Siddhanta time is Cosmic Time
and, secondly, it is temporal which is the temporal
correspondent of things in flux. One is called Lokanam-
anta-krt-Kala which comprehends all things in
existence, and the other is time in respect of calculation,
‘Kalanatmaka’. Yama in this hymn is not the god of
death, it is the child of the sun, Vivasvan. Therefore
Yama should be interpreted as time, in both aspects,
i.e., temporal aspect and beyond the temporal in its
eternal aspect which is the space-time continuum of








Time, first and highest of existence, knows as it
comprehends our course of life, and that course no one
can avoid, escape, alter or alternate, and that same is
the path by which our earlier forefathers went their way,
and that is the path by which all who are born go their
way, knowing according to their Dharma and choice.
Honour that time with homage.






Terrestrial fire and bodily heat grow by food
and fuel, Yama, life time and life energy, grows by pranic
energy, and Brhaspati, spirit and enlightenment, grows
by Vedic words and divine joy. These capacities which
divinities of earth and heaven and divine enlightenment
augment, and the divinities of the environment on earth
and above, which humans augment, grow mutually, the
divinities by svaha oblations, and humans by svadha
offerings of food, and thus they rejoice.

O Yama, happy life time of health and joy, come
in union with nourishing and protective energies of
nature and vest those energies in my yajnic body system.
Let the thoughts and health mantras of the sages come
with you here with exhilarating and inspiring poetic
voices, and then, shining and ruling in the system within
with all these gifts, rejoice and make me happy too.






O Yama, life time of health and age, come with
pranic energies of nature of various and versatile sort
worthy of union and assimilation according to time and
seasons, be happy and rejoice with me. I invoke the
refulgent Sun also, your generative father, and pray
come and be seated in the holy heart core of this life
yajna of mine for a full age of good health and joy.
(Reference may be made to Atharva Veda 3, 8, 1: May
the sun come with its rays joining and entering the earth
and energising it according to the seasons. Rgveda 1,
71, 2 throws further light on the science of health and
solar rays in relation to the earth and global atmosphere.)

Go forward, O man, move on by the ancient
paths of life universally carved for you, by which the
forefathers too went forward to complete their course

Pitarah Devata, Shankha Yamayana Rshi


Pitaras in this hymn means nature’s life giving,
life preserving and life promoting pranic energies,
especially the sun rays which start an invigorating yajna
with the dawn and continue it upto sun set. It also means
the flames and fragrances of yajna rising from the vedi
and joining the natural energies to enhance the efficacy
of nature’s recuperative power for life. On the human
plane it means the seniors, the enlightened, the teachers
and social workers, men of experience, vision and
judgement who contribute to the welfare and progress
of society with, their actions and ideas. It does not,
however, rule out pitaras of human tradition and history
who continue to live by their ideas and ideals they
contributed for the progress of society, to whom we feel
grateful for their living guidance even after their

O Jataveda, that part of human personality which

Tvashta, cosmic maker of forms of existence,
for the fulfilment of the creative urge of nature, Prakrti,
initiates the process of evolution and the entire universe
comes into being in cosmic time. While Prakrti, consort
of the self-refulgent creator Savita (Tvashta Being its
forming faculty) and mother origin of the order of
evolution, is fertilised and moved on to its generative
function, it disappears, that is, it converts from its

original and intangible essence into the tangible creative
form and power in existence.

Transforming the original immortal constant

and master, and then in that dynamic state as it is then,
it bears a twin pair of evolved existence, the Ashvins,
positive-negative complementarities of the evolutionary
circuit of nature’s dynamics, and produces procreative
couples such as Agni and Soma, energy and matter,
prana and rayi, male and female, presence and absence
(as the two may be described from different points of
view).






O man, may Pusha, lord of life and nourishment,
omniscient sustainer and pervasive protector of the

abide.

Pusha knows all these paths and directions of

Aspirants to knowledge and the light of divinity
invoke Sarasvati, voice of divinity, they offer homage
of faith and devotion in psychic and spiritual yajna
which expands their intelligence and vision. Men of
noble action invoke Sarasvati, ever flowing Spirit of
Knowledge, for strength of will and direction. May
Sarasvati grant cherished gifts of knowledge, will and
vision to the generous yajakas.






O divine Sarasvati, cosmic voice of divinity,
who radiate and expand on the rays of light and rejoice




with homage of faith and devotion and the inner

Just as days follow in succession, the latter
following the former and the former living on in the
latter, just as seasons go on by order of the seasons of

devotion as you are, Tvashta, the cosmic maker, ordains
a full life of long years for you to live in joy.

the last trace of negativity and force of destruction.






When Indra, glorious lord ruler of the world
rides his golden chariot of state which complementary

Vasukra: O mighty ruler of wealth and power,
Indra, happy performers of the yajnic system, with the
best of equipment, extract exciting soma juice and they
prepare sanative tonics from vrshabha herbs, of which,

when cordially invited, you drink and taste with pleasure
to your satisfaction and fulfilment.




4. Idam su me jaritara cikiddhi pratipam sapam


O celebrant, know this force of my power: By
the dynamic force of my system and order, the stream
of ordered life can carry off criticism, opposition and
contradictions and throw out all poisonous elements,
the ordinary vegetarian citizen faces and drives off the
violent carnivorous enemy, and a single clarion call
would dig out and throw out the most destructive
terrorist forces from the darkest den.






O lord of wealth and power, all knowing all
watching ruler of the world, Indra, how would I, a simple
man, understand and know this mysterious ground
power and policy of yours, wise and versatile master of
the mighty order. O lord, you alone know, you alone
can enlighten us about the admirable basis and direction
of your policy of peace and progress of humanity




according to the time and season.

soul, ruler of the system. The foundation, structure,
direction and stability of the system, the power I wield
to sustain and rule the system is greater than the vast
single stroke. Indeed the creative powers that generate
and manifest me as power generate me without enemy
and opposition.




7. Eva hi mam tavasam jajnurugram karmankar-


Thus do the devas, divine powers and faculties
create and know me as mighty and formidable, virile
and generous in every act of the system. Happily with
the mighty vajra, vital power, I break the dark cloud of
rain with mighty thunder and open the paths of progress
for the creative and generous vital channels of the
dynamics of the system.

8. Devasa ayan parasunrabuibhran vana vrscanto


Let men of power and enlightenment march
forward bearing weapons of defence and action, felling
forests and oppositions, march forward with people of
the land, stay the floods of rivers, release the flow into
streams and canals, burning the undergrowth and drying
up pools of stagnant water.





The deer faces and beats up the tiger of fatal

10. Let Suparna, Indra, the soul on top all
round of the living system and at the centre of the self,
confirm, hold and monitor its power-in-readiness as this:
Like the lion in the den ready with his paw, like a rhino
in position thirsting to strike (as a battery of force and
power calibrated unto the live switch) and the power
like the bow string in optimum tension would strike
and throw out and far off the negativities and enemies
wherever they be, (such is the force and power of prana,
spirit and soul of the living system at individual, social
and cosmic level) in service for the master, Indra.




11. The systemic strength in optimum tension
spontaneously throws out those who, feeding on the
nutriments provided by the system itself, abuse, revile
and sabotage the social order, eating into all the
creativities of the system and thereby, at the same time,
damage the strength of their bodies by themselves.





12. Those persons rise to creative power and


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 29 549


grandeur who, with holy words and noble acts of yajnic
creations of soma peace and vitality serve life and
humanity and strengthen and advance the body of the
social order and thus address the ruling power: O ruling
soul of the order, speaking and proclaiming as leader,
pioneer and ruler, bring us all our share of sustenance
and power, acknowledge our achievement and victory,
and feel great that you wield the honour and power of
the order, yours is the name and the glory from earth to
heaven. You are the heroic brave.

Like the baby bird placed in the nest on the tree,
waiting and watching for the mother bird, and the mother
bird arriving, may this song of love and purity reach

day and night of human activity



2. Pra te asya usasah praparasya nrtau syama






Indra, ruler of the world, manliest leader of the
leaders of humanity, lord of triple splendour of
knowledge, action and spiritual advancement, who
command a hundred heroes by virtue of power and
thunder, source of peace, advancement and bliss, may
we ever abide in the light and joy of the dawn of today
and of other days to come in our course of life.






What is the most exhilarating song of prayer

Indra, like the sun that leads from darkness to
light, inspire and lead humanity to the attainment of
their desire for freedom across the world, all who
entertain this ambition like their love for home life
earlier. O lord of infinite manifestation, bless all those
people who adore you with songs of universal
exhortation, who guide others to sing and pray with
universal voice, and who offer homage to divinity with
foods and charity in various forms.


6. Matre nu te sumite indra purvi dyaurmajmana




O Indra, lord omniscient and omnipotent,
mother earth and the heaven of light, both ancient and
eternal in the existential cycle, are created in excellent




measure of form and function by your vision and power.
May the delicious and refined honey drinks of soma
and sumptuous foods gifted by sun and earth be
exhilarating and delightful for noble humanity and for
their yajnic homage to you.






Let us offer the honey sweet bowl] of our heart
and soul overflowing with love and faith to Indra who
is truly magnificent and munificent. He is the benevolent
guide of humanity and supreme leader of leaders and
by his powers, potentials and creative actions manifests
higher and exalted over the expansive earth and space.




8. Vyanalindrah prtanah svoja asmai yatante


Indra, lord of holy light and lustre, pervades the
peoples’ heart and soul within and joins them in their
struggles in the world outside. The best of people since
time immemorial try to win his love and friendship with
homage, prayer and meditation. O lord of cosmic
chariot, ruler of the world, come to us to bless us and

Let our voice of thanks and praise, our acts of
yajnic creation and self-sacrifice in service of the cosmic
sustainer, reach all the divine energies and powers of
nature and humanity which are ever on the move and
sustain life, and let this expression be the very symbol
of the total dedication of our mind and soul. O celebrant,
O high priest of yajna, proclaim and realise this our
will to live as a mighty gift of the lord of love and
judgement, and proclaim as well our vision of the
ultimate freedom from selfish attachment, which we
would realise in dedication to our own spirit, to the social
order, and to the infinite lord of cosmic dynamics with
the same love and judgement.



2. Adhvaryavo havismanto hi bhuta’cchapa






O priests and organisers of the socio-cosmic
order, bear and bring the fragrant materials of yajnic
action for development, rise with passion and
enthusiasm, reach the vaulting waters of life, and with
open expert hands today receive the waves which the
moon and ocean raise and the flood of light and energy
which the sun showers down.






O priests and organisers, reach the ocean and
the waters of space and connect with the sun and light
in space and skies with the right materials of yajna. The
sun never allows the waters to exhaust and gives you
the purest showers ever. Create and offer the sweetest
and most powerful soma oblations to the sun for
permanent supply of liquid energies for the sustenance
of life.




4. Yo anidhmo didayad-apsvantar-yam viprasa tlate


O sun who burn and shine in space without fuels

yajna, who never allow liquid energies of the world to
exhaust, pray give us the honey sweets of liquid energies


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 30 555


by which Indra, ruler of the world order on earth, may
rise to strength and accomplish great deeds for humanity.






The liquids with which Soma, the ruling spirit,
rejoices and feels exhilarated as men feel happy and
exhilarated by noble youthful women, those exciting
liquid energies, O high priest of yajna, find from far
and near, and when you find them, then cleanse and
strengthen the drinks and sanatives for health and joy.




6. Evedyune yuvatayo namanta yadimusannu-


Just as youthful women submit to young men,
and as men with love eagerly advance to loving women,
so do the leaders of social and scientific yajna know
the liquid energies of nature and with their science and
intelligence create, obtain and develop. So do also they
develop the energies and competence of the rising
youthful generation for the social yajna of the world
order of humanity.






7. Yo vo vrtabhyo akrnodu lokam yo vo mahya abhi-


O people of the social order of the world,
committed to honesty and loyalty, the ruler who opens
the doors of freedom against inhibition and creates a
beautiful world for you, for that Indra, mighty ruler,
create honey sweet fragrances of exhilarating
environment and offer him divinely joyous foods and
drinks of self-fulfilment.




8. Prasmai hinota madhumantamurmim garbho yo


O streams of life aflow, O dynamic people blest
with wealth, honour and excellence, listen to my call
and exhortation: Create and set in flow the sweetest
honeyed waves of joy for this master power and ruler
who is the fountain head and fathomless ocean source
of your joy and fulfilment, refulgent and illustrious,
adorable in the noblest yajnic meets of the world.




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 30 557




O streams of life, dynamic people of the world,
inspire and set in motion that joyous wave of living and
working worthy of all ruling Indra which helps to realise
both ends of life, fulfilment over here and freedom of
moksha hereafter, overflowing with divine ecstasy,
admirable, heavenly, universal, good for earth, heaven
and the middle regions, continuous for three living
generations, dynamic as the river and deep as ocean.




10. Avarvrtatiradha nu dvidhara gosuyudho na


O sage, visionary celebrant of the yajnic world
order, respect, honour and celebrate the vibrant people
of the land, fluent in action like winding streams,
dedicated in thought, word and deed to the two streams
of individual and collective good, observing a compact
order of law like fighting forces deployed on fields of

achievers of yajnic development, having a common
origin and growing and moving together in one
direction.

action in cooperation, for the achievement of wealth,
honour and excellence raise the voice of divine
knowledge, application and action, in the pursuit of
collective action under the laws of nature and grateful
humanity, open the sluice gates of clouds and unlock

you rising and coming in response to the call and prayer
of the high priests and celebrants of yajna, bearing water,
milk and ghrta and the honey sweets of life for fertility
and life’s generation, in perfect union with the mind,
hopes and aspirations of the priests and yajakas on the

and joy for Indra, ruling power and reigning glory of
life.




14. Ema agman revatir-jivadhanya adhvaryavah


Friends, priests and yajakas, these waters,
vibrant energies of nature and dynamic powers and
personalities of humanity, all overflowing with life,
fertility and generative potential, are come here. Give
them an honourable place in yajna. They know, they
are united with us, and they are blissful, and they never
allow the waters of life to exhaust. Know them, seat




them on the holy grass and create the beauties and joy
of life for all.




15. Agmannapa uSsatir-barhiredam nyadhvare asadan


Brilliant, fluent and divine energies, powers and

excellence of the world for our protection and progress.
May we be good friends with them and cross over all


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 31 561


hurdles, sins and evils of existence.




2. Pari cinmarto dravinam mamanyad-rtasya patha


Let mortal man love and desire wealth, honour
and excellence in the comprehensive context of the
world and divinity, shine and refine it with faith and
reverence by the path of truth and universal law, speak
of it, think and define it with his own conscience in
communion with divinity, and then, with his own mind
and soul, realise the high degree of expertise, vision
and perfection of thought, action and achievement for
himself. (Divinity, humanity, nature, the world around,
these are the context of our success and achievement.)






Maturity of thought and concentration is
achieved, vibrations of thought in waves flow in,
protective and illuminative for the spirit in virile posture
like waves of flood on the holy shore. Thus may we
achieve the power of success and prosperity, thus may
we be knowers and achievers of the boons of immortals
in knowledge, awareness and, in fact, in our very being.






4. Nityas-cakanyat svapatirdamuna yasma u devah


May the lord eternal, master of the world’s
wealth of Prakrti, generous and potent, love to give and
bless humanity for whom Savita, lord creator and
generator provides all things of existence, and may
Bhaga, lord of universal power and prosperity, and
Aryama, lord of justice and dispensation, enlighten him
with the word of knowledge, and may the lord of love,
beauty and bounty, provide man the sweet shade of
protection for advancement.






When clouds laden with power and plenty of
rain, and sages with words of enlightenment and power
come and bless the earth, then this world of humanity,
like the light and freshness of the dawns, shines and
prospers on earth, and seekers of wisdom and power
asking the sages for knowledge and wisdom of divinity
and power and advancement on earth flock here to us,
and we pray may power and prosperity continue to flow
in for us and our children.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 31 563




6. Asyedesa sumatih paprathana’bhavat purvya


This knowledge and wisdom, this Vedic voice
of this sage of divinity, may, we pray, be universal,
eternal and ever expansive, and may we, united and
organised together on this equal and undivided earth,
abide under the same one social order of this mighty
life-giving ruler, living safe, secure and sustained in a
state of peace and progress.






Which is that forest, which was that tree, that
material cause, from which the Vishvedevas, divine
powers of lord Supreme, fashioned forth the heaven and
earth sustained in cosmic order in the imperishable
universe, safe and protected, which the eternal days and
nights and the dawns at morning and evening proclaim
and adore.


8. Naitavadena paro anyadastyuksa sa dyavaprthivi






There is no other universe like this nor beyond
this, and yet there is one power not just exactly as this
but beyond, and that is the mighty generous creator and
generator who bears this heaven and earth. That is the
master lord of Prakrti, his own Shakti, the mighty
material cause of the universe, and he creates and
structures the sacred form of it and bears it all as the
cosmic energies and space directions bear the sun.




9. Stego na ksamatyeti prthvim miham na vato vi ha


As the sun lights up and transcends the earth, as
the wind shakes the cloud of life showers and passes,
so does he pervade and transcend the heaven and earth,
so does he move the universe to creative activity. Where
Mitra, the sun, and Varuna, the moon, 1.e., the couple—
prana and apana, heat and water, sun and air, sun and
moon, energised and impassioned, create and release
life energy, heat and desire, there Agni releases the life
of life as fire releases heat and vests it in the wood.



10. Stariryat suta sadyo ajyamana vyathiravyathth

Like the heifer, mother Prakrti (void of life in


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 32 565


pre-creation stage of existence) is immediately energised
and impregnated by the Spirit of life Supreme, master
of the herd of living forms. The original and efficient
cause, first mover, creates motion in the unmoved and
unmoving, and makes the potential forms move in their
orbits. The saviour protector and presiding power that
existed awake as ever, even before the parental couples,
manifested in action and mother Prakrti gave birth to
forms which now ask, seek and worship the mystery.




11. Uta kanvam nrsadah putramahuruta syavo


And man, the intelligent, they call the child of
divine energy. The vibrant, the wise and bold achieve
the wealth of life and divinity, and for such as draw the
attention and love of divinity, the lord opens his treasure
hold of joy and blesses them. None other than divinity
can bless humanity with joy and ultimate fulfilment.


Mandala 10/Sukta 32
Indra Devata, Kavasha Ailusha Rshi









May Indra, omnificent spirit and highest
presence of the universe, cherished object of the
meditative seeker, move to accept the best of the seeker’s
acts of homage and surrender and bless him in his state
of clairvoyant ecstasy with the objects of his love and
desire. Indeed Indra, who acknowledges the homage
and service of the man dedicated to search for divinity,
loves, joins and rewards our search for knowledge and
action with fulfilment.






Indra, omnipotent light of the universe, adored
and worshipped by all, by your universal light and
energy you pervade and radiate over all divine
luminaries of earth, heaven and all space. Those who
continuously send up their prayers and dedicate their
yajnic actions and endeavours to you win the fruits of
their prayers and worship and thereby eliminate all their
want and deprivations.





MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 32 567


Let it be more and more pleasing for me as soul
in body form then when man grows more and more
handsome than beauty itself in existence, when the child
born of parents carries the family line higher forward,
when the wife pleases the husband and exhorts him with
sweet words to love and noble thoughts, and it is nice
and auspicious for the man to be good and cleansed at
heart by love and loyalty.




4. Tadit sadhasthamabhi caru didhaya gavo yaccha-


Indra, give us a bright happy home where
illuminative voices of divine Vedic wisdom rule and
lead the family as horses draw the chariot, where the
mother is honoured as the first and intelligent centre of
the family and where the inmates are healthy and virile
with all the seven vitalities of physical health.






O seekers of divinity, there is only one guide
and leader for you who creates and provides the ultimate
haven for you with the divines. And that is Indra who
readily and instantly comes with his powers of justice,




reward and punishment. And among the seekers of
immortality and freedom, divine worship and adoration
alone is the ultimate and unfailing giver. Therefore offer
honeyed hospitality and sincere worship for the
divinities that provide the means of protection,
advancement and immortality.




6. Nidhiyamanam-apagiulhamapsu pra me devanam


The protector and preserver of the laws of
divinities, Indra, divine spirit and teacher, enlightens
me and speaks of the fire and spirit of life, Agni,
pervasive and concealed in the waters, in particles of
Prakrti abounding in space and in the will, awareness
and acts of humanity. O Agni, Indra, the spirit, only
experiences and watches your presence. Taught,
enlightened and committed by Indra, I have come to
the realisation of your presence.






Let the man ignorant of the field of life ask the
teacher who knows the field and facts of life and who
can communicate, and, thus taught and trained, go
forward in the business of living. This only is the holy


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 32 569


and auspicious end and aim of teaching and training
for life. And this is the way of the evolution and
development of tradition by which man gets enlightened
on way to progress.






Just today Indra, the soul, starts receiving the
energy of prana in the womb, then, covered in the womb
these days, it has the feel of its existence, then, when
born it sucks the mother’s milk, then it grows, thought
and language comes to it, adolescence and youth, and
finally old age takes it over the youth. O lord, let the
resident soul in the body be holy at heart without anger
and frustration.






O treasure hold of knowledge, Indra, O learned
teacher, O listener of my praises and prayers, these are
the holy acts of reverence and adoration which we,
givers of thanks and presents, perform in homage to
your honour. O men of wealth and power of knowledge,
let this knowledge and this presentation of thanks and
appreciation be a holy gift of gracefulness and culture,




and so may this soma of knowledge be for you, the
knowledge which I hold at heart in myself.


Mandala 10/Sukta 33


(6-9) Devatah, Kavasha Ailusha Rshi






May the divine givers of knowledge and
enlightenment to the people inspire and enlighten me
too, so I hold the lord giver of life and nourishment
dear to my heart in the soul. May the divinities of heaven
and earth in nature and humanity protect and promote
me. The indomitable is come: this is the declaration.

freedom from limitations and eternal bliss.

my existence, then I would be really alive in all my
power and potential for all time.





No soul of a hundred year life on earth, even if
it had a hundred lives, can live beyond the laws of nature
and divinity, therefore it has to leave and return to life
with its natural concomitants of body and mind again
and again in the cycle.

8, 10, 11, 14) Devata, Kavasha Ailusha or Aksha
Maujavan Rshi






The large quivering dice, made of vibhidika tree
grown on grassy green mountain slopes, shaking and
rolling awesome on the dice board, tantalise me like
the sight of exhilarating drink from a munyja grass
covered mountain valley, they excite me and I lose my








This gentle lady, my wife, is good to me and to
my friends, she never quarrels with me nor does she
embarrass or hate me. Alas, for one reason, my persistent
addiction to gambling, have I alienated my devoted wife
totally dedicated to her life’s duty.






Normally speaking, the wife of a gambler feels
indifferent and alienated from him, the mother-in-law
hates him, the wretched man finds no friends’ sympathy,
there is none to comfort him. Like an old, exhausted,
otherwise, no one bids for him. I set no value upon the
gambler. Who would?



4. Anye jayam pari mrsantyasya yasyagrdhadve-


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 34 575


the mighty dice have cheated him of his money and all
wealth. Father, mother, brother, all disown him and say:
off with him, we bound and taken. We know him not.






When I realise and think I must not play with
dice and must not be miserable, even then, having so
decided, I succumb to the approaching dice as to
seductive friends. Red and shining dice cast in the game
rattle and resound, and I walk into the den like a woman
stealing to her paramour.




6. Sabhameti kitavah prcchamano jesyamiti tanva


Puffed up in body and mind, the gambler moves
to the gambling house asking, even assuring, himself
in mind: Shall I win? I must, this time. And his dice,
held and poised in hand to defeat his rival, inflame his
fire to play and win, more and more.








The dice hold the gambler by the hook, pierce
like a dagger, hew down the man and even his family
from the root, as a hatchet, burn like fire and torture
like incessant pain. For the winner, they bring joyous
gifts for the time but later in turn they destroy, and
though soaked in honey for the moment, they tear the
gambler to pieces at the end.




8. Tripancasah krilati vrata esam deva iva savita

The group of fifty-three of those dice is played
strictly within unsparing rules of the game like the divine
sun observing the laws of its motion. They do not bow
even to the strongest of men, indeed the ruler bows and
offers obeisance to the dice (if he too is addicted).






MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 34 577

strongest armed warrior. Thrown upon the dice board,
they can be burning brilliant and some time, even though
ice cold, they burn the heart.




10. Jaya tapyate kitavasya hina mata putrasya


The forsaken wife of the gambler suffers at
heart, the mother of her child wandering somewhere
feels tortured by loss. Down under loss and debt, pining
for money, he is oppressed by fear, and at night goes to
other’s home either for shelter or for money the way he
can get.




11. Striyam drstvaya kitavam tatapa’nyesam jayam


The gambler suffers when he sees his wife, and
he regrets when he sees another’s wife well settled, their
noble acts and comfortable home. Yet again in the
forenoon he grabs the tempting dice as a warrior takes
to his steed, but when the fire is gone cold, he falls
down broken and farlorn.






12. Yo vah senanirmahato ganasya raja vratasya


O dice, O gamblers, to that which is the first
and foremost of you, the ruler of your mighty order and
organisation, the leading warrior over all of you, my
homage and salutation with farewell with folded hands
and all the ten fingers, open all in front with the vow
that I would lose no money any more, and this is the
be, because his hands are empty now.)





Play not with dice. Till the land. Be happy with
the land and wealth you produce. Take it that that much
is enough and be content. There are the cows, O gambler,
there your wife is happy. This is what Savita, lord of

Vishvedevah Devata, Lusha Dhanaka Rshi






In the early hours of the dawn, those flames of
morning fire bearing light and energy of the sun awake
and awaken the great heaven and earth, dispelling the
darkness, and arouse the people to the karmic business
of the day. In this very morning hour of the day, we
pray for the protection and promotive energy of the
divinities of nature and humanity for enlightenment.







We pray for the good will, protection and
inspiration of heaven and earth for light and
nourishment. We want the love and blessings of mother
powers, the energy and liquid flow of the streams and
seas, showers of clouds, the cool of mountain snows
and gifts of soma herbs. We pray for the energies of all
that is dynamic and generous in life. Innocent and free
from sin, we pray for the rise of a new dawn and light
of the sun every day. May the peace, beauty and
inspiration of nature at dawn inspired with the love and
power of divinity bless us with vision, will and power
to act here and now so that we too may rise and shine.






May this new day, the great mother powers of
earth and heaven, generous givers of inspiration, light
and settlement, protect and promote us, their innocent
children, for the sake of happiness and well being. May
the bright dawn now rising keep off sin and evil. We
pray that the lighted fire and rising light and all
enlightened powers of human will and action be good
to us and all may be well and blissful.

malice of the unbearables and take in and internalise
the love and enthusiasm of the most challenging
discipline of life divine. We pray may the lighted fire
and rising dawn bring all happiness and all round well
being of life.






The lights of dawn at the break of day which
shine with rays of the sun, bearing the message of

produced in the land submit in reverence and loyalty.






Indra, ruler of the world, invoked and celebrated
by all, by that thunderbolt of power and justice which

adversaries by the power of his ardent soma offerings
of holy action in yajna.






As rivers flow into the sea, as streams of rain
flow into the lake, so do the beauties of faith and pleasure
in soma yajnas concentrate on Indra, glory of the world.

People of the first order dedicated to divinity

lowest orders of being.

Agni Devata, Vatsapri Bhalandana Rshi




Agni first manifests as light in the high heavenly
region in the form of the sun. Secondly it manifests as




Jataveda, vital heat in all earthly forms around us. In
the third form it manifests as energy in waters in the
middle regions of space as electricity. Agni is the vital
energy which enables humanity to live and work. Man
as self-intelligent being lights this perpetual Agni and
thereby exalts and celebrates the eternal creative spirit
of existence.

Agni, universal vital energy, we know the three
modes in which you menifest in three different forms,

abode is since we know the infinite source from where
you arise and manifest as Agni, Vayu and Aditya on
earth, in sky and in heaven.






Agni, the fluid energy excites and kindles you
in the currents in the depths of the waters; in the region
of light, the sun that illuminates the world of humanity

the skies, the energy of the winds produces and
augments you as you abide in the depths of the cloud.

Agni roars as if thundering and shaking the
skies, at the same time reaching and kissing the earth
and beautifying the greenery. Always present, instantly
rising, it proclaims itself, shines, and fills the heaven
and earth with its light.






Liberal source giver of light, beauty and life’s
graces, treasure home of wealths, honours and
excellences, harbinger of intellectual smartness and
fulfilment, protector and promoter of the soma energies
of life, shelter home of peace and comfort, child as well
as energiser of strength and courage, and the ruling
inspirer of the soul in will and actions, Agni, kindled
and rising, shines in advance of the dawns at the horizon.








Illuminator of the world, pervasive life energy
of the universe, as it rises it fills the heaven and earth
with light and life. Moving ahead and penetrating, it
breaks the mighty strong cloud, and for this reason of
its energy, power and light all communities of the world
kindle and adore it in their yajnic projects of creation
and production.






Charming, purifying, dynamic, inspiring the
mind and intelligence to acts of holiness, immortal Agni
pervades in all mortal forms of nature and humanity. It
bears and emanates light, sets in motion free fragrance
for life and, with powerful pure light, fills the heavens
of space.

individual body and the cosmic form, ruler and
controller of everything, that bears and brings you all
food and energies and blesses you with all wealth,
honour and excellence of life.

Just as people search for a lost animal by
following the foot prints of the animal in the forest,
similarly seekers and aspirants of this Agni, omnipresent
in the dynamics of existence, try to search for it by the
overt as well as covert marks of its presence in the wide
world of nature, and the deeply dedicated brilliant sages,
loving and patient in their persistent search with yajnic
homage, self-dedication and surrender, find it vibrating
in the cave of the heart and soul.








The ardent lover of divinity, Trita, the man
having got over threefold suffering of body, mind and
soul through knowledge, good work and meditation,
finds this Agni presence on top of inviolable nature and
earthly life in the absolute state of consciousness. Thus
realised in spiritual manifestation, Agni, harbinger and
augmenter of spiritual felicity, becomes the centre hold
of happy homes and a youthful presence of divinity in
the mind of enlightened souls.

of holy materials for social development. They hold
Agni at heart and create and exalt it as the prime power
among the people.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 46 639






Earnest men of love, passion and faith, but,
being human, limited in intelligence, hold at heart,

all knowing and wise, breaker of the strongholds of
negativity and darkness, the original seed and source
of life, beatific, supremely intelligent, golden flamed
and divinely adorable. Men hold at heart, worship and
serve this omnipresent Agni being more dynamic than
the dynamics of nature, the instant presence that it is.




6. Ni pastyasu tritah stabhuyan parivito yonau sida-


Agni, the light of three worlds, all supportive
and sustaining, enveloped in light and flames, sits in
the vedi in the homes as in the midst of regions of the
universe, and from there, having received the homage
of yajnic oblations, the generous Agni reaches the
leading divinities of nature and humanity in various
ways according to different laws of nature.








The eternal, adorable and all saving flames and

pervasive in forests, clouds and waters, and they are
vibrant and blissful as the soothing pleasures of soma.

centrality of the system. Those who challenge me, I
destroy, whether it is one or two or three. I crush them
all as sheaves of corn on the threshing floor. It is a pity




8. Aham gungubhyo atithigvamiskaramisam na


For the protection and advancement of the
unostentatious people of piety and creativity among
humanity, I hold and maintain persons and powers that
are hospitable, producers of food, and destroyers of sin,
evil and violence, and I protect them like the very
nourishment of society, since Iam known and celebrated
for what Iam and what I do: eliminate the forces counter


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 48 649


to growth, break the cloud for rain, and dispel darkness,
want and ignorance.






My celebrant is worthy of love and honour,
because he is for sustenance, enjoyment and
procurement of knowledge for society. He is loved and
honoured for two reasons: for friendship and for
enlightenment. And when I have given him the light in
abundance in the battles of life, only then I raise him to
the position of praise and celebration.




10. Pranemasmin dadrse somo antargopa nemama-


divine spirit of joy, beauty and peace, the protector

11. Adityanam vasunam rudriyanam devo devanam


Light of lights, generous and potent, I never
violate, frustrate or transgress the identity, function and
power of the Adityas, zodiacs of the sun, of Vasus,
natural spheres of life sustenance, or Rudras, forces such
as winds and pranic energies. Nor do I ever disturb the
aditya, rudra and vasu scholars of knowledge and divine
service. Let them all realise me and manifest my spirit
and presence for their good and fulfilment of their
prowess: me, Indra, undaunted, unviolated and


Mandala 10/Sukta 49


Indra Devata, Indra Vaikuntha Rshilndra Devata, Indra
Vaikuntha Rshi






I give to the celebrant of divinity eternal peace
and freedom of the soul, the highest value of life across
the world of existence. I create the eternal song of
existence for self celebration in joyous exaltation. Iam
the giver of inspiration to the yajnic performer and
partner in cosmic evolution, and I subdue the negationist
and uncreative soul in the entire struggle of life for
evolution.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 49 651




2. Mam dhurindram nama devata divasca gmasca-


Living beings of land, waters, heaven and all
spaces and all that move, they accept and adore me in
faith as Indra, the omnipotent sustainer. I keep the
twofold dynamic forces of high velocity constantly on
the move in the cosmic process of evolution, and I,
power supreme, wield the thunderbolt as my sceptre of
omnipotent justice and dispensation.






I pierce and dispel the darkness for the visionary
seer, giving him the break-through and the light with
radiations of illuminations and revelation. I protect the
sage with these modes of protection and advancement.
I, dispeller and destroyer of drought and want, wield
the thunderbolt for the negationist and the destroyer
whom I do not recognise by the name of a creative






4. Aham piteva vetasurnrabhistaye tugram kutsaya


Like a father for the good of the man of creative
generosity, I subdue and throw out the obstinate and
persistent forces of bruteness, violence and terror. I am
for the advancement of the man of yajnic creativity and
enlightenment, and I have nothing good for the violent
and the bully.






I subdue the roaming mind of the learned man
so that it matures and, always by thought and action, it
abides in me without going astray. I condition the inner
spirit of man to humility, love and kindness, and I
remove the obstacles from the path of the man on way
to progress.


6. Aham sa yo navavastvam brhadratham sam


rocanakaram.


I am that who, like breaking of the cloud, destroy


MANDAL - 10/SUKTA - 49 653


the evil tendencies of body and mind extending to new
areas like epidemics expanding and covering large
terrilories, and thus I am that who throw away for all
time all that sin and darkness which would otherwise
go on rising and expanding in effect and intensity.






I manifest all round in glory as my presence is
conducted by fast radiations of sun rays, and when the
celebrant of soma yajna for peace and joy calls on me
for fulfilment of his essential nature in divinity,
immediately I strike off all impediments by strokes of
the thunderbolt as the negativities deserve.




8. Aham saptaha nahuso nahustarah prasravayam


I am the destroyer of sevenfold darkness (of
passion, anger, greed, infatuation, pride, fear and
sorrow) by sevenfold light of divinity. I am the bond
between humanity and divinity, stronger than strength
itself. The aspiring man of action and effort, I raise to
heights of honour and fame. Others, I fortify with




courage and patience, and the rising ones, I cause to
rise higher by nine and ninety times for a full life of




9. Aham sapta sravato dharayam vrsa dravitnvah


Infinite, generous and omnipotent, I cause the
seven streams to flow and the seven seas to roll on earth,
and I cause the seven streams of blood and nerve to
flow in the body. Master of holy action, I provide for
the river’s flow, and with the dynamics of nature and
society, I provide the paths of progress for humanity on
way to fulfilment.





I create and cause to flow that bright fluid in
these seas and streams of earth and the body which no
bright power of nature or humanity, not even Tvashta,
the divine artist, could have created and made to flow:
the lovely milk in cow’s udders, honey sweet waters in
the rivers, and the sparkling life blood in the body’s


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 50 655
veins, the essence of vitality.




11. Evadevan indro vivye nrn pra cyautnena magha-


Thus does Indra, lord of glory and protector of
Truth and Law, impel and inspire natural and human
forces of generous and positive action with energy. As
such, all men of action and excellence over the world
exalt and adore you, O lord of radiant presence,
omnipotence and innate excellence, and they feel blest
in themselves.


Mandala 10/Sukta 50
Indra Devata, Indra Vaikuntha Rshi




You seekers and celebrants, offer reverence and
homage with service, prayer and selfless work to Indra,
omnipresent guide, giver of happiness and fulfilment
to all people of the world, whose holiness of universal
creativity, strength, grandeur, honour and glory, and
gracious generosity, both heaven and earth proclaim and
adore.






2. So cinnu sakhya narya inah stutascarkrtya indro


He, Indra, Lord of heaven and earth, leader and
master of humanity with love and friendship for all,
loved and adored universally, is worthy of worship for
all men like me. O lord omnipotent protector and
promoter of the good and true, you rejoice, exhilarate
and energise us in all top situations worth challenging
in the world, in all battles of the brave worth winning,
and in all states of darkness and showers of the clouds.






Indra, who are those people that try to win your
favour of sustenance and enlightenment, who realise
your divine bliss of peace and well being, who exert
themselves to win the strength and spirit of life and joy
of divinity, and who delight in their own acts of
ambition, manliness and generosity?

4. Bhuvastvamindra brahmana mahan bhuvo

Indra, you are great by virtue of your infinity
and eternity of Being and the eternal Word of Being
and Divinity. In all holy works of creativity in the world,
you are adorable. In all struggles of existence, you are
the power and inspiration of humanity. And you are the
first, highest and the most sacred chant of human
consciousness of divinity, O lord all watching and
inspiring for the world.




5. Ava nu kam jyayan yajnavanaso mahim ta oma-


Indra, you are great, pray protect and promote
the lovers and performers of the divine yajna of faith
and creativity. People know the grandeur and greatness
of your power of protection. Unaging and imperishable
you are, pray promote life and all. Indeed, ultimately, it
is you who effect all these acts of creation and progress
with strength and speed.

This sukta is a dialogue between the Devas such
as Mitra, Varuna, pranic energies such as prana and
udana and Agni. Agni here means many forms of energy
of the world of existence: earthly agni that is fire, middle
regions’ agni that is electricity, and self-refulgent agni
that is light of the solar region. In Vedic literature, it


MANDAL - 10/SUKTA - 51 659


means energy not only in these forms but also in many
more forms, that is, the vital heat of life, the passion for
living, the spirit of life, the body heat, the vital virility,
life itself, the soul and the cosmic spirit. This wide
context is relevant to the present sukta.






O Agni, Jataveda, cognizable in existential
forms, great is that form, that cover, that medium, fine
and firm, clothed in which you enter upon the course of
life in existence. There is one Divinity which watches
all your body forms existent in nature in various media
in the world.




2. Ko ma dadarsa katamah sa devo yo me tanvo


O Devas, who saw me? Which is that Divine
who sees me in my body forms in so many ways? O
Mitra and Varuna, O sun and moon, O vital energies of
prana and udana, say where abide all my bright and
vital waves and flames of fire and energy in the world
which light up the paths of divinity and lead humanity






3. Aicchama tva bahudha jatavedah pravista-magne


O Jataveda, manifest in all that is born and come
into existence, Agni, we seek for you, co-existent as
you are with all waters, motions, plants and trees. Yama,
the One Divine who directs all things in existence knows
you and watches you, O mysterious presence of infinite
forms, shining, illuminating, energising and vitalising
life from the depth of ten orders of existence: ten sense
organs, ten pranas, and ten physical abodes, 1.6., earth,
skies, heavens of light, the fire, electric energy, the sun,
waters, plants, trees and the living bodies.




4. Hotradaham varuna bibhyadayam nedeva ma


O Varuna, lord of judgement and choice,
soothing spirit of waters cool in peace, afraid of self-
sacrifice to the senses and to the fiery divinities, I, the
soul, come to you from the burning fire. Here neither
the senses nor the divinities would consume me. As such
my body and body organs with all waves and vibrations
are completely merged in you. Here I know no such
purpose as there in the fire.


MANDAL - 10/SUKTA - 51 661






Agni, come, you are the soul, director of your
divine senses and mind, thoughtful and intelligent, lover
of divinities, dedicated to yajna. But you are still steeped
in darkness. Come, get ready for yajnic performer.
Prepare the paths of divinity for yourself and, happy at
heart, carry the holy fragrances to the divinities by yajna.




6. Agneh purve bhrataro arthametam rathiv-


O Varuna, earlier my brothers created the same
paths for themselves as a charioteer selects the road for
himself, but they went off. For that reason I have come
this far to you here, and I tremble with fear as a deer
shakes with fear from the twang of the bow string of a









O Agni, O soul, known as born in the body, we
create and ordain an unaging life for you so that joined
to that life divine you come to no hurt, nor would you
die, and then, happy at heart, happily born, you carry to
the divinities that share of the yajnic homage which is
meant to be dedicated to them.

O Devas, give me the prayaja, food part of yajnic
offerings, and the anuyaja, supplimentary part of food,
and that part of the offerings which gives energy, light
and vision, the lustre of liquid energy, vitality from herbs
and plants, long age of health for the soul and freedom
from death. O Devas, brilliant, illuminative generous
givers. Give me only that part which is mine.



0. Tava prayaja anuyajasca kevala urjasvanto


O Agni, O Soul, yours is the prayaja part of
yajnic food, yours is anuyaja, the supplimentary part.
Let all this be for experience and for the realisation of
your essential spiritual nature. And let your share be


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 52 663


full of energy and light for you. Indeed all this yajna of
your individual existence is for you, the soul, as the
cosmic yajna of existence is for the cosmic soul. Let it
not go counter to the soul. Let all four directions of
space and all that therein is be for experience and self-
realisation. (Let it be subservient to the soul, let not the
soul be lost in the experience of it.)

powers of nature and humanity, men and women,
teachers and preachers in the socio-economic system,
yours is the conduct of the organisation of yajna day by
day at and from the very rise of dawn. Let the Vedic
scholar, bright and cool like the moon be the Brahma,
presiding high priest, and act like ignition and
illumination of the fire, and let that light and fire be the
concluding oblation into the fire.






Who is this hota, yajnic performer, who carries
out any and all the powers and obligations of Yama,
order and controller of the whole system, whom all the

Me the devas, divines, honour and uphold while

system for them and face the many difficult and most
laborious situations even in the minutest details with
perfect discipline. Hence they all say: This Agni, the
light and fire of the system, well aware of life and its
conduct, accomplishes the yajna, threefold, five ways
and seven stages.






O devas, as I do honour and service to you in
the best manner, as I pray for your gifts of immortality,
virility and vitality, and as I hold in hands the ruler’s
thunderbolt of justice and dispensation, this way does
man win all the battles of life.




6. Trini Sata tri sahasranyagnim trimsacca deva


Three thousand three hundred thirty and nine
are the divinities that serve this yajaka, Agni, shower it

He whom we Devas loved and sought with heart
and mind is come. He knows the integrated process of
yajnic union, knows all and every part of it. May this
unifying principle of life, most venerable, join us here
in the yajna of life, infact it was abiding here itself within
before we joined. (The Devas are the divine principles
and faculties of life, and Agni whom the Devas love
and seek is the life itself, the soul, which integrates the
faculties with the identity that the soul acquires with
the body and the faculties, all united in one organismic
individual form. Reference may be made to Aitareya
Upanishad, ch. 1, 2 and Atharva-Veda, 5, 30, 17).





MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 53 667


The high priest, Agni, lovable and adorable, is
seated on the vedi. Honoured and adored, he also
observes with interest and favour the sacred offerings
placed with faith and reverence on the vedi in homage.
We adore and worship all the divine powers that deserve
and command our worship and adoration. They deserve
service and we adore and worship them with the homage
of ghrta and fragrant havi.






May Agni beatify our yajnic service to the
assemblage of divinities on the vedi today so that we
may have their blessings and hear the secret voice of
divinity by the flames. May the life spirit, harbinger of
health and happiness, come today bearing the fragrance
of life and render our divine worship full of blessings
and all round well being.




4. Tadadya vacah prathamam mastya yenasuran


I, Agni, presiding power of corporate life by
yajna, now think and meditate upon that first, highest

dedicated to divinity, may overcome the evil adversaries.




Let all those who live on energy foods and join together
for noble creative works in the spirit of yajna, and the
people of all the five classes and communities listen
and follow my call to action.

sin and evil earthly, and may the skies protect us against
all dangers from the space above.

Lovers of Soma, peace and joy, bind the traces,
harness the horses, tighten the reins and refine them to
perfection, move on the eightfold chariot all round, the
chariot by which the divines bring in the dearest
treasures of life. (This mantra is a metaphor of the
eightfold path of yoga from the control of senses and
mind to the attainment of samadhi which marks the
communion of the soul with divinity.)

cross over to attain the trophies of victory.






9. Tvasta maya vedapasamapastamo bibhrat patra


The cosmic maker Tvashta, supreme expert of
the artists of the world, knows the mysteries of karma
and the secrets of fortune or misfortune, and most
beneficent as he is, he carves and fills the most delicious
cups of joy for the holies. The lord of cosmic wisdom
also makes and sharpens the golden axe of knowledge,
justice and dispensation whereby the man who attains
to this prize knowledge cuts at the root of his karmic
tree and drinks the nectar of universal sweets of freedom
from the divine cup.




10. Sato nunam kavayah sam SiSsita vasibhiryabhira-


O men of vision and seekers of divinity, sharpen
and refine your golden axe of knowledge with the voice
of Brahmanaspati, lord omniscient, by which you
prepare for the attainment of immortality. O scholars of
knowledge, carve out the mystical paths to divinity,
work out the progressive stages by which the seekers
of divinity attained to the nectar of life eternal.




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 54 671


11. Garbhe yosamadadhurvatsamasanyapicyena


The devas, seekers of divinity, hold the Word
of omniscience like the sacred vedi fire in the depth of
their mind alongwith the reality of existence signified
by the Word, and they hold it with the sense of clarity
of expression by their tongue controlled and disciplined
in the mouth. Indeed such a man of divine word and
action in control is always happy at heart and all round
efficient, and only such a man wins the victory prizes
of life.

Indra Devata, Brhaduktha Vamadevya Rshi






Indra, lord of glory, I celebrate that renown of
yours by the greatness of which the earth and heaven,
both struck with awe, call upon you and glorify, by
which you protect the holy and generous brilliancies,
subdue the unholy negatives and destroyers, and by
which you award the strength and lustre of life to your








As you pervade among people, self-exalting by
the power of your presence, and thereby manifest your
own glory, and as poets and sages sing and celebrate
your battles against evils within and without in the world
of humanity, all this glory is but your own essential
divine potential, and that is why you have had no enemy






Which ancient sages and seers before us could
ever comprehend the bounds of this absolute glory of
yours since you brought into existence both earth and
heaven together as mother and father of life from your
own material power of Prakrti?

O great and glorious Indra, four are your states
of being, four the modifications of existential

manifestation, all of them living and imperishable,
which all, O dear lord of life of the universe, you know
and by which, O lord of cosmic majesty, you perform
the acts of universal life in existence.


(The four states of cosmic being are waking,
dreaming, sleeping and the transcendent Absolute. Four
states of existence are generation, sustenance,
withdrawal and the trans-existential state. Four Prakrti
modifications are Prakrti, mahat, ahankara and the
specifics of material and mental forms of physical,
biological and psychic stages of evolution which are
then absorbed into the Absolute state at the end.)
Reference may also be made to ‘Om’ which is the divine
Word, the name of divinity consisting of four matras A,
U, and M and the fourth is silent and absolute. ‘A’ refers
to the waking, that is, the objective state of existence
which is the subject of science. ‘U’ refers to the
imaginative and subjective state which is the subject of
psychology and meditation upto the stage of ‘vitark’
and ‘vichara’ samadhi, and ‘M’ refers to the sleep state
which is realisable in ‘Ananda’ state of Samadhi. All
these are covered under the Samprajnata Samadhi. The
fourth, transcendent state, is realisable in Asamprajnata
samadhi which is Transcendental Meditation).





You bear and absolutely comprehend all the




treasures of existence, manifest as well as unmanifest.
Pray do not frustrate my longing for fulfilment. Indra,
you are the knower, the ordainer and the giver.

Far too distant and far too deep is that name
and lustre, O lord of glory, Indra, for indifferent people
to understand and appreciate which the heaven and earth
struck with awe call upon for sustenance. O lord of glory,
you sustain both heaven and earth in space in
complementarity with each other and illuminate the rays

of the sun and lightning of the cloud, both brotherly
providers of sustenance to life.




2. Mahat tannama guhyam purusprg yena bhutam


Great and deeply glorious is that name and
divine presence universally loved and adored by which
you create all that has been and that which would be.
That light and glory of this Indra is eternal, ever existent
and dear to all into which all the five people that love
him and are dear to him and all the five elements of
nature retire (when the cycle of existence has run a full
circle).






That glorious presence pervades and fills heaven
and earth and the middle regions, fills and energises
the five divine elements, five senses, five pranas, seven
regions of the universe, seven rays of light, forty nine
orders of the winds, all according to the seasons of time,
and it watches and illuminates thirty four orders of
divine powers of eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve
Adityas, nature’s nourishment by Prajapati, nature’s




energy of fire, electricity and light, and Vak, the
articulation of consciousness, all in many ways, with
different functions and effects.




4. Yadusa aucchah prathama vibhanamajanayo


O Dawn, when you arise and shine first of the
lights of the lord, Indra, and bring in fresh life for the
world generated and nourished by Indra, then your
motherly love for humanity is the one unique and great
life giving blessing of the supreme spirit of divinity for
humanity on this earth.






Old age consumes even the youthful man of
versatile action whom many fear to face in battle and
flee. Look at the inscrutable power of the lord divine
by whose inevitable law of mutability the man who was
living yesterday is dead today, and the one that dies
today would be living to tomorrow.

The forefathers lived in the grand manner of

acts and worship to the presence and piety of divinities.
They join those lights of divinity which shine and then
again they come back to join life in their existential
bodies.







These souls by their own karmic potential roam

Children of divinity, creative and procreative

There is a thread of unity, love, cooperation and
active continuity in the web of life in nature’s divinities,
and a similar bond of unity in an enlightened community
which alone keeps it together and leads it on way to




corporate progress. It is created and maintained with
relentless self sacrifice in the spirit of yajna. Let us attain
and maintain that very bond of yajnic unity for our
progress and prosperity. (That is the bond of Agni, vital
heat and love.)





We invoke the mind, alert ourselves and, with
songs of human approbation and celebration, join with
the thoughts and wisdom of our parents and ancestors

That most expansive creativity and generative
vitality of Rudra Prajapati, lord creator, animated and

motherly agent of nature’s innate urge for self-

When the generator, father, and the youthful
maiden, the mother, both joined in love and marriage
with the desire to fulfil their obligation to Prajapati, lord

fulfilment, is an extension of the process of divine
creativity initiated on top of heaven at the centre of






As the father, the sun, covers the skies and the

person of stingy character takes no step forward and
neglects the ordinances of charity, then Agni, otherwise






The master of the home is the leader, burden
bearer and the voice of the people. He must never defile

energy, honour and progress of the nation, who works
for its unity and advancement with his power, patience
and fortitude.

living energy, meet with homogeneity of the beautiful
earth and, in contact with both the sun and earth, join
the all sustaining gravitational life force, and, without
taking anything for themselves create and give universal
showers of imperishable creative and motherly fertility

of a fast whirling wheel.

He that holds the two worlds of heaven and earth
in bond, the high priest of cosmic yajna, all pervasive
power that helps us to cross over the flood of existence,
gives us the immortal gift of eternal Word and vision
when a person, with the best of chant and meditative
practice, realises together Mitra, centripetal, and Varuna,
centrifugal, processes of cosmic dynamics, and also
Aryaman, the all-controlling spirit that controls both
the centre and the circle of the wheel of existence.


18. Tadbandhuh surirdivi te dhiyandha nabhanedi-
O soul, says the celebrant in love with divinity,
that binding bond, the sun in heaven, is the giver of


your will and intelligence and also its guardian, your
closest link of nature to life eternal. That navel link is




our highest centre of existence and of that, in
consequence, I am the devoted celebrant among many.

This is my navel link with life, here is my haven

the children of humanity under your care.








Rshis are seers of various forms of existence
including the structures and meanings of the voice
divine. They are powers and performers of serious and
mysterious actions. They are all Angirasas, children of

Those Adityas, children of eternal light blest

Manu, omniscient creator, lighted the first fire of
creative yajna with thought and tapas and conducted
the yajna with seven priests (five elements with mahat
and Ahankara, seven pranas, sevenfold sense and mind
complex, seven rays of the sun, seven sages and seven
chhandas of the Veda) may, we pray, bring a peaceful
life and home with freedom from fear and make our
paths of life simple, straight and clear from darkness
and evil for the good and all round well being of life.






Those divine, brilliant and generous powers of
nature and humanity with a noble heart and mind that

Brhaspati Devata, Ayasya Angirasa Rshi







MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 67 745


revealed for us this universal voice of knowledge
spontaneously. Structured in seven metres, it is born of
the lord’s awareness of Satyam and Rtam, 1.6., the eternal
and mutable truth of existence and its laws of evolution,
sustenance and involution. He, the original source of
the birth of the universe and its knowledge and language,
also revealed the fourth and silent mode of existence in
the transcendent state of Moksha beyond the earlier three
of Dharma, Artha and Kama without effort and spoke it
for Indra, the soul.

experience the first and original presence of the adorable






Chanting with friends as with hansa-like simple




sinless souls of purity, breaking the adamantine chains
of karmic bondage, loudly proclaiming the divine Word
of omniscience, Brhaspati, master celebrant of the

sings and adores the lord divine.

Brhaspati, master of language, wishing for the
light of knowledge and expression in the midst of the
darkness of the web of the world of mutability, expresses

vaikhari, which he expresses by two media of thought
and word, and the one hidden below, i.e., Pashyanti, he
apprehends through one, the deeper mind in meditation.
Thus he reveals the three modes of language. (The fourth
is Para, the silent mode of language in its originality
beyond the world of mutability which can be realised
in the highest state of Samadhi.)




Brhaspati, the seeker of light, in the state of
turiya beyond deep sleep, breaks through the three bonds


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 67 747

throws the demon away lamenting, recovers and enjoys
the light of knowledge with the voice of divinity and
showers of bliss in a state of clairvoyance.






Brahmanaspati, master, protector, promoter and
ruler of the world of existence, blest with divine light,
vision and speech breaks down the thief of cows, Le.,
hoarders, exploiters and destroyers of the wealth of life.
He breaks them down with the help and cooperation of
friends and associates who are generous, self-fulfilled,




fervently dedicated to truth, purity of conduct, laws of
Dharma and rectitude, and blest with ample means and
materials for the achievement of their goal. Thus does
he recover and establish wealth and common wealth
for the individual and the society.

Brhaspati, master, protector and ruler of the expansive
system, together with his associates at his full command,
with safeguards against negativity, scandal and calamity,
creates and organises a nation of freedom and progress
ranging over the earth in peace and joy.

When Brhaspati achieves food, energy and

generous master ruler with words of adoration.




11. Satyamasisam krnuta vayodhai kirim ciddhya-


O Brhaspati, O leading lights of humanity, for
food and energy, good health and age, fulfil the hopes
and ambitions of the people and justify your words of
purpose to the point of truth without compromise.
Protect the cooperator and celebrant with your own
power and security. Then let all violence, enmity and
sabotage be overcome and cast off totally far away. And
may the heaven and earth, givers of universal fulfilment


listen to our prayer and adoration.




12. Indro mahna mahato arnavasya vi murdhanama-


Indra with his might breaks the top of the great
ocean of waters in space and, breaking the dark cloud,

watchful guards raising their voice, like the rolling
rumble of rain clouds, like rippling streams flowing
down mountain slopes, the celebrants raise their hymns
of adoration to Brhaspati.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 68 751






Just as Angirasa, enlightened disciple of the sage
of living knowledge, like Bhaga, divine lord of light
and grandeur, leads his friend to knowledge and
prosperity, as a friend leads a couple in the community
to come together in marriage, so O Brhaspati, inspire
and energise the aspirants to go forward and win their
goal by the light and words of divinity.


fava: nau




Replete with pure, living energy, ever on the
move, loved, coveted, brilliant golden, beautiful in form,
such are the rays of light and vitality which Brhaspati,
the sun, recovers from the deep caverns of darkness
and sends them down to clouds and earth as a farmer
sows the seeds of barley in the field.


4. Aprusayan madhuna rtasya yonimavaksipa-






Sprinkling the womb of life with the honey
sweets of vitality like the sun radiating the rays of light
from the regions of heaven, Brhaspati recovers the
showers of life from the clouds and, as showers of water
seep into the crust of earth, so the seeds of life are vested
and borne in the earth.






As the sun removes darkness with light from
the middle regions, as the wind removes the cover of
moss and grass from the surface of water, so does
Brhaspati, lord of the expansive universe, with deep
thought, remove the cover of the darkness of nescience
and sets in motion the dynamics of nature’s creativity
in circuits of energy as the motions of the wind.




6. Yada valasya piyato jasum bhed brhaspatir-


When Brhaspati with the flames of fire and rays
of the light of his creative will breaks through the
darkness of nescience covering the primeval potential
existence and takes it over as the tongue takes over the


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 68 753

vast reservoir of his energies of the dynamics of creative
nature.




7. Brhaspatiramata hi_tyadasam nama svarinam


Brhaspati knows the name and identity of these
voluble facts and processes of existence which are
present but hidden in the deep womb of nature and
which, radiating like rays of light and flowing like
streams, grow and come into being as chicks on maturity
break the bird’s egg and spring into full life.




8. Asnapinaddham madhu paryapasyan-matsyam na

Brhaspati sees the sweetness and beauty of
human life caught up in the bonds of pleasure and
sufferance in the body like a fish caught up in shallow
waters, and he raises and refines it like a cup of soma
for the divinities, crafted from rough wood, having
refined and blest it by the resounding voice of revelation.






9. Sosamavindat sa svah so agnim so arkena vi


The blessed man realises the light of the dawn
of knowledge, the light and bliss of heaven, the vision
of refulgent divinity, and with that light wards off the
darkness of evil and ignorance. Indeed, Brhaspati raises
the man subject to body, senses and mind, now blest
with divine vision like a real man, otherwise completely
sinking in the depths of darkness and evil.




10. Himeva parna musita vanani brhaspatina-


Just as the leaves of forest trees are made to fall
by winter, so darkness is dispelled and light is created,
so is ignorance dispelled and the light of Vedic revelation
revealed by Brhaspati, and that is an act he does
unparallelled and unrepeated as long as the sun and
moon shine together and illuminate the days and nights.


11. Abhi Syavam na krsanebhirasvam naksatrebhih


Like a dark horse adorned with golden
trappings, the rays of light adorn the heavens with stars.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 69 755


Brhaspati vests darkness in the night and light in the
day, breaks the cloud, releases the light and showers
recovering the light of existence from the night of
annihilation, and enlightens the heart of darkness with
revelations of the light of divinity.




12. Idamakarma namo abhriyaya yah purviran-


This homage we offer to Brhaspati, lord of living
waters and thunder, who reveals the eternal words of
divine knowledge. May that lord bless us with good
health and long age with lands, cows and the light of

progeny, leading lights and enlightened people.


Mandala 10/Sukta 69
Agni Devata, Sumitra Vadhryashva Rshi

1. Bhadra agner-vadhryasvasya samdrso vami

May the controlled and directed radiations of
light and yajna fire, Agni, be auspicious, may its
inspiration and guidance be auspicious and rewarding,




may its associations and functioning mutualities be
auspicious. When noble and friendly people kindle and
install it in the prime position in the vedi of yajna then,
raised and fed on oblations of ghrta, it rises and shines,
adored and exalted by the celebrants.


(This metaphor of physical fire and light, of
which the flames and radiations are controlled and
directed, is extendable to the socio-political and
educational life of the human community. In this context
Agni is to be interpreted as the leader, ruler, commander
and teacher, leading the people to auspicious
attainments. And, as in the case of all words indicative
of divinity, Agni is the supreme lord of light and life
whose divine functions are all self-refulgent and self-
controlled, leading us all to auspicious attainments.)





Ghrta means and is the rise and exaltation of
self-controlled self-directed Agni, ghrta is the food, and
ghrta is the growth and expansion with love and grace.

Fed on ghrta it rises and expands unbounded and,

kindled, energised and exalted with ghrta, it shines

glorious and beatific like the sun.

Agni, power of controlled light and flames of

Agni, divine leader of light and life, always wins

Mandala 10/Sukta 71
Jnana (Knowledge) Devata, Brhaspati Angirasa Rshi




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 71 767


O lord of Infinite Speech, Brhaspati, the first
and original form of eternal speech, which is the
integration of name, word and factual reality, which the
sages receive and bear in mind and articulate at the dawn
of human creation, lies immanent in the universal mind.
It is borne in the best and immaculate minds of the sages
who make it manifest from there by divine inspiration
in a state of grace.






When the sages of patient and transparent mind,
with their thought and imagination, conceive, visualise
and articulate the divine word, crystallising it to the state
of purity as they sift the grain of truth from the chaff of
local variety, then the friends and associates come to
know of the idea and the word and the union of word
and meaning in communication, and then noble and holy
is their knowledge manifested and received from the
depth of the sage’s language.






By yajna and meeting of minds on the vedi, they




get to the form and meaning of language, tracing it word
by word in the structure, realising the reality of meaning
hidden in the mind of the sages. And having reached,
realised and received it, they bear it around and
communicate it in many ways widely in many places at

4. Uta tvah pasyan na dadarsa vacamuta tvah


However, even in association, in spite of
discussion, someone having seen the language, let us
say, in print, or having seen the meaning in practical
the language by the ear may not hear it in the soul. But
Speech to someone, some honest, conscientious
dedicated soul, opens up and reveals its hidden meaning
as a loving wife beautifully clad opens and reveals
herself, her very soul to her loving and faithful husband.

with him, nor contradict him. But some may not even
come to the fringe of his attainment. And another one
moves around like a barren cow, struck by the magic of
mere sound of words, hearing language without fruit or




6. Yastityaja sacividam sakhayam na tasya vacyapi


If someone forsakes the divine speech of the
Veda, a real intimate friend for life and after, there
remains no substance even in his speech of daily wear,
and whoever listens to him listens in vain because he
does not know the path of well being and of well doing.






Indeed friends and companions equal of eyes
and ears are unequal in mind and intellectual efficiency.
Some are like tanks just waist deep, others neck deep,
and yet others are deep as lakes, rivers or even seas
wherein you bathe and feel sanctified and absolved.






8. Hrda tastesu manaso javesu yadbrahmanah


When scholars in close friendly association join

subjects, actively move on with discussions of latest






Those there are who pursue neither the
knowledge of this material world nor the knowledge of
the spiritual world, nor are they Brahmanas interested
in the holiness of the world of reality, nor even do they
follow ritual and worldly life consciously with open
mind. So being ignorant people they use only the non-
holy language of impiety and merely extend the thread
of physical existence at the human level in their life.

reputation and social prestige, and such a person,
eliminator of sin and evil, provider of food and
knowledge, rises to the position of leadership among
them, being good for their honour and enlightenment.




11. Rcam tvah posamaste pupusvan gayatram tvo


Of the devotees of the divine voice of the Veda,
one chants, celebrates and maintains the energy and
enthusiasm of life vibrating in the Rks, one, the udgata,
sings the gayatri verses in the Shakvari hymns of power,
the Brahma, presiding high priest, proclaims the verses
of universal knowledge from all the Vedas, and another,
the adhvaryu, orders and organises the entire programme
of the yajna in all details.

Devah Devatah, Brhaspati Laukya, or Brhaspati
Angirasa, or Aditi Dakshayani Rshi






Let us proclaim in clear words of grateful




adoration the birth and evolution of nature’s divine
manifestations which, when the verses are chanted, one
may see and appreciate in later ages to come.






Brahmanaspati, lord, master and ordainer of the
cycle of existence, sets these devas in motion like an
artisan in the earliest age of evolution and they awake
from the unmanifest state of Being into the manifest
state of Becoming in existence. (The Avyakta,
intangible, becomes the Vyakta, tangible, mode of






In the first age of the devas, the manifest stage
of existence arose from the unmanifest Zero stage, 1.e.,
the Zero state emerged into the first positive state of
existence after Zero. Then in consequence arose space
and the quarters of space. Thereafter arose Uttanapada,
the open ended possibilities of boundless evolution
further. (The one Vyakta gives rise to potential




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 72 773


4. Bhurjajna uttanapado bhuva asa ajayanta.


From Uttanapada arose Bhu, specific possibility,
and many more such arose in space in the spatial
quarters. From Aditi, inviolable nature, arose Daksha,
will and intelligence, and from will and intelligence,
Aditi, the desire to grow and procreate further.






O Daksha, lord of will and intelligence, Aditi is
born which is your offspring, indeed your desire to be
many. In consequence, the devas are born, the noble
fraternity of the immortal (Nature and divinity).


The order of the birth of the devas is thus
described in the Upanishads and in Sankhya philosophy
of natural evolution it is this: From avyakta Prakrti
evolves Mahan or Pradhana which is vyakta Prakrti.
From Mahan arises Ahankara which is described here
as Uttanapad or the tree of the universe. From Prakrti
are also manifested the three qualilative modes of
existence: Sattva or intelligence, Rajas or energy, and
Tamas or solid matter. This same is the order here in a
different terminology. From Ahankara are born the five
subtle bhutas and both mental and perceptive organs.
From five subtle bhutas are born the five gross bhutas:
Akasha, Vayu, Agni, Apah and Prthivi which all are
composed of paramanus, the smallest units.






6. Yaddeva adah salile susamrabdha atisthata.


O Devas, when you abide and play together
dancing as if joyously in that vast space, then your
radiant energy and ecstasy rises high (to receive the
descent of life as the ripe gift of the sun on high).






energise and enliven the regions of the world, so here
too in the ocean of matter, energy and prana, you hold,
support and cherish the bright sun, the soul deep under
the mysterious fivefold cover of existential body form.




8. Astau putraso aditerye jatastanvaspari.


Eight are the divine modes of Aditi, eternal
inviolable Prakrti, which are evolved from her
personality like children born of the mother (these being
Mahan, Ahankara, five material forms and the sense-
mind complex which is called Martanda because it bears
the soul which passes through the birth and death
stages). With seven of these it goes on evolving and the


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 73 7715


eighth, Martanda, it leaves aside free (to grow by itself
with the soul in the human form).






With seven of her children mother Aditi retires
to the post-pre-creation stage of the Avyakta absolute,
but she continues to bear the Martanda, the soul with
the subtle body cover during Pralaya, for birth and death
again and again in the eternal cycle of existence. (For
8-9, further, refer to Gita, 7, 4-5, and Aitareya


Mandala 10/Sukta 73

Indra, ruler of humanity and the world, adorable,
is born to subdue pride and opposition to humanity, and
when mother Infinity, or humanity, fortunate and
rightfully proud, bears such a brave hero, leader and
ruler, the Maruts, leading lights, adore and exalt him.








The armies of the enemy of darkness and pride
stand round him well ordered and deployed with fighting
forces ready for the move, and they abundantly exalt
Indra with universal songs of praise. The people safe
all round covered with mighty defence and security rise

Indra, great and elevated are the columns and
constituents of the system you rule over. When you
advance and win your goal, the most eminent leaders,
scientists and technologists, warriors and whoever
others are here, all praise and exalt you. You appoint
and maintain thousands of vigilant guards on the
forefronts of the land. Indra, keep the social economy
and all subsystems of the order moving, keep the circuit

Going fast forward in the struggle of life, you
move close by the ways of yajna, holding on to the
common creative values of corporate life and bringing
all complementary forces of the system together for
friendship ever in action for advancement. Indra, brave
hero and ruler, hold and manage the wealth of the nation
while the Ashvins, complementary forces of the system,
create and contribute a thousand forms of honour, wealth
and all round prosperity to the commonwealth.






Further, happy and joyous with the rule of
inviolable law and dispensation of justice, Indra creates,
holds, manages and provides wealth and well being for
the people with the cooperation of his friendly and
enthusiastic colleagues, and with these very cooperative
forces faces the negative elements, negates their
mischief and dispels all fog, depression and oppressive
darkness from the land, uproots all these.



6. Sanamana ciddhvasayo nyasma avahannindra






Indra, dispel the darkness of the forces of equal
name and power and subdue them with your light like
the sun which overtakes the car of the dawns and turns
it to day. Move forward with heroic friends who are
brilliant and ambitious and with them together win the
firmness and stability of your heart’s desire.




7. Tvam jaghatha namucim makhasyam dasam


You subdue the miserly hoarder and the
negative, destructive clever trickster and convert him
to be a lover of yajna and social generosity, living a
simple natural life for the advancement of the seer. You
make the paths of human progress peaceful and
enjoyable, holy, simple and natural to follow for the
pilgrims of divinity.




8. Tvametani paprise vi namesana indra dadhise


Indra, you fill up all these agents of positivity
with strength. Ruling and controlling, you hold the rule
and justice like the thunderbolt in hand. Consequently
all the divinities of nature and humanity rejoice and exalt
you with power and joy. Indeed you turn all the clouds
above downwards to release the showers of life giving

rain.




His wheel of power and presence which operates
across the spaces and rules the dynamics of nature and

fertilises the earth and fills the clouds, the nectar that is
filled in the cow’s udders and sweetens the sap in the




10. Asvddiyayeti yadvadantyojaso jatamuta manya


While some say this power and presence comes

alone knows the mystery.






11.  Vayah suparna upa sedurindram priyamedha


Men of vibrant intelligence and flying

O flowing stream, as you flow for the energy
and vitality of foods in plants, herbs and trees, or as
you flow by the tops of mountains of the earth or as you
elevate the first and best part of these living and moving
forms of nature with pranic energy, the sun makes the
path for your flow.








When the force and flood of energy is set in
motion by the sun, the rumble of infinite energy shakes
the spaces in heaven and the atmosphere on earth. As
thunder roars and reverberates from the sky, so do
showers fall and the river flood flows resounding like
the cloud.



4. Abhi tva sindho sisuminna mataro vasra arsanti

O Sindhu, flood of water, just as mothers move

warrior king leading his armies to the battlefield for




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 75 785




O Ganga, ever flowing stream of water, life and
life energy, Yamuna, stream that joins others and flows,
Sarasvati, stream of abundant water and light of life,
Shutudri, fast flowing stream of water and energy,
Marudvrdha, stormy stream of water, prana and passion
for life, Arjikiya, overflooding stream of life breaking
over the banks, along with Parushni, sparkling stream
flowing through stages, and Sushoma, stream of peace
and vitality deep as the fathomless ocean, Asikni and
Vistasta may all listen to this song of homage of mine
and bless life.


Note: It is said that the words from Ganga to
Sushoma are names of ten particular streams. It is not
so. According to Yaska and Swami Dayananda, Veda is
universal knowledge, there is no history and no
geography in this body of knowledge. If particular
streams are called by these names, the names were
derived from the Vedas in which those name-words
already existed, and the name-word and the
characteristics of the stream corresponded. For this very
correspondence, certain nerves, arteries and veins in the
body also were named after these Vedic words. Pandit
Jaya Deva Sharma in his translation of Rgveda
p. 131) quotes from a Kerala manuscript on music the

kutilagamini) which goes through the vertibrae of the
spine is shining, Asikni is dark, Marudvrdha is
augmented by all nadis, Shutudri is fast and full, Vitasta
controls body temperature, Arjikiya originates from a
centre called Rjuka in the brain, also called vipat which,
if it breaks, then death occurs and the pranas and the
soul forsake the body. For this reason it is also called
urunjara. Sindhu is the soul into which retire all the
pranas and the nadis. Thus ‘streams’ and names of
streams are general terms of life’s dynamics in different
physical, psychic and spiritual contexts.




6. Trstamaya prathamam yatave sajuh susartva


O Sindhu, flood and ocean of the dynamics of
life, the streams which you first join and go on by the
body chariot of existence are: Trshtama, the nadi with
which food is first digested in the stomach, Susartu by
which the energy produced is distributed over parts of
the body system, Rasa by which energy vibrates across
the whole system, Shveti by which food energy joins
the blood stream, Kubha by which the skin cover is

other senses are controlled, Krumu which controls and

Rjiti which moves peacefully, Eni which
controls the white corpuscles, and Rushati which is
bright and creates the body lustre, move by the energy

of the same law.






The Adityas are mighty by Soma, divine energy
and law of existence. By Soma, the earth is great and
adorable. And in the closest environment of these stars
Soma is abiding in concentrations as sustaining energy.




§nani kascana.




The person who drinks the soma juice feels that
the herb which they crush and squeeze for the juice is
soma. But the Soma which the divine sages know and




4. Acchadvidhanairgupito varhataih soma raksitah.
vah.


Preserved by divine ordinances, protected by the
measures of Brhat Samans, Soma is guarded safely by
somapalas. O Soma, you abide somewhere in divinity
hearing the roar of thunder and clouds, no one earthly
can drink or experience the ecstasy of your celestial
nature and identity.






O divine Soma, when the sun rays drink you as
the moon in the first, dark half of the month, then you
come up to full growth as the moon in the second, bright
half of the month. The wind, cosmic energy, is the
protector of soma in its place. Thus the month is the
constituent of years and presents the full form of the
two equal fortnights of the moon.


Note: Mantras from 6 to 16 are a metaphor
which can be interpreted as wedding of the dawn in the
context of nature and the Veda, and as wedding of a


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 85 821


maiden and relevance of the Veda in the human context.
The maiden and the dawn are synonymous.




6. Raibhyasidanudeyi narasamsi nyocani.


Raibhi verses of the Veda are the bride’s
wedding gifts, Narashansi verses, the bride’s ornaments,
grace and good fortune, her bridal robes sanctified by
exemplary verses relating to the good life.






When Surya, the dawn, the new bride, goes to
the house of her groom, then her noble mind and thought
is her resting couch, her gracious eye, the collyrium,
and the earth and heaven, her treasure.




8. Stoma asan pratidhayah kuviram chanda opasah.


Hymns of adoration are the axle of her chariot
wheels, music of the hymns, her head scarf and cushion,
the Ashvins, prana and udana energies, are friends of
the groom, and Agni is the first call of maturity.








Soma is the proposer and Ashvins, pranic
energies, the first attraction and attention, when Savita,
giver of life and light, gives away the bride, love-lorn
at heart, to the groom.






The mind is her bridal chariot, bright sky its
canopy, the sun and moon the motive powers when the
bride, like the glorious dawn, goes to her own home
with the groom.




11. Rksamabhyamabhihitau gavau te samanavitah.


Sun and moon, both equal and glorious, yoked
and celebrated by Rks and Samans, move the chariot
on the new procession. Let revelation of the Word and
infinite Space be the movement towards advancement,
and let the path be both tumultuous and restful over the
moving and the unmoving world unto the light of
heaven.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 85 823




12. Suci te cakre yatya vyano aksa Ghatah.


Surya, the new bride, rides the chariot of the
mind when she moves to the house of the groom (with
her dreams of the future). When she moves, her pure
ears are the wheels (on which the chariot moves because
the mind moves in response to the stimulants of the
senses) and the wind, psychic energy of thought, is the
axis of the wheels.




13. Suryaya vahatuh pragat savita yamavasrjat.


The bridal procession of Surya proceeds which
Savita, her father, starts. The bullocks are made to move
the chariot in Magha constellations and the bride is
inducted into the groom’s home in Phalguni




14. Yadasvina prcchamanavayatam tricakrena


O Ashvins, married couple, when you come
together by the three wheeled mental chariot of Sattva,
Rajas and Tamas constituents of personality in balance,




asking for fulfilment of the wedding of Surya, let all
the Vishvedevas, nobilities around and the mind and
senses within, know and approve your intent and
purpose, and then let Pusha, future progeny for
sustenance, select the life giving parents for the arrival.




15. Yadayatam subhaspati vareyam suryamupa.


O Ashvins, protectors and promoters of life’s
good, noble men and women of reason and passion,
when you come to the bride, darling choice of the groom,
where is one of the wheels of your chariot and where
abide the two for the purpose of benediction?






O Surya, bride of the new home, the sages of
knowledge know the two wheels of your life’s chariot
according to the seasons, 1.e., your words and actions
according to your moods and circumstances. The third,
thought, reflection and intentions, is hidden in the depths
of the mind which only exceptional master minds know.
And that one is a mystery.

These two, sun and moon, move on in sequential
order by their own power and virtue, playing happily
like innocent children and go on participating and
contributing to the divine yajna of the cosmos. Of these,
one watches and enlightens all regions of the world and
the other rises again and again according to the season
and thereby setting the seasons in order.






The moon rising again and again ever anew,
proclaiming days and lunar dates, comes ahead of the
dawn in the dark fortnight. While coming it brings its
share of the havi for divinities and gives long life to
biological and human life.






20. Sukimsukam Salmalim visvarupam hirnyavar-


Welcome, O bride, bright dawn of a new
morning, ride and rule the golden, well structured, well
geared chariot of ahomely world, beautiful and glowing

bliss of immortal joy for the husband and the family.

23. Visena bhanguravatah prati sma raksaso daha.


Agni, with pervasive and expansive light, heat
and penetrative flames and with beams of constant
action against the negativities of life and society, pray
burn up the crooked and destructive elements of life in
every field of their activity.




24. Pratyagne mithuna daha yatudhana kimidina.




Agni, burn up the oppressive and destructive
alliances and combinations of the negativities of life
and nature on the prowl looking for where to strike. O
power all intelligent and wise, with holy thoughts and
prayers, I invoke and exhort you. Arise, O power
indomitable, and strike against the killers.




25. Pratyagne harasa harah 51117007 visvatah prati.


Agni, universal spirit of light and fire, creator,
protector and destroyer, refulgent ruler of nature, life
and society, with your love and passion for life and
goodness and with your wrath against evil, sabotage




and negativity, seize, cripple and all round destroy the
strength, vigour, valour and resistance of the negative
and destructive forces of evil and wickedness, lurking,
working and persisting in nature, life and society. Save
the good and destroy the demons.


Mandala 10/Sukta 88


Surya, Vaishvanaragni Devata, Murdhanvan Angirasa
or Vamadevya Rshi






Devas, the divines of humanity and divinities
of nature, with food and reverence, offer delicious,
expansive, loved and solemnly dedicated havi into the
holy fire which rises to the skies and reaches the sun.
Thus do they exalt Agni so that they may well be, rise
and exalt in the gracious order of Agni under the divine
shelter and support of the order.





The world of existence lay deeply engulfed and


covered in the darkness of the night of Pralaya,
annihilation, and then on the rise of Agni, Lord Supreme


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 88 857


of light and life, it rose and manifested: Akasha, time-
space continuum manifested, and then others followed,
earth, light and heat, waters, herbs and trees all arose,
and all the devas, divine spirits of nature, rejoiced in
the love and friendship of this Lord Supreme, Agni.






Inspired by Devas and lighting the fire of yajnas,
I adore and exalt Agni, lord unaging and eternal, infinite,
who, by his self-refulgence, pervades this earth and
heaven and expands both heaven and earth and the
middle regions of the skies.




4. Yo hotasit prathamo devajusto yam samanja-


I adore and exalt Agni who is the first, original
and efficient cause of the cosmic yajna, loved and
celebrated by the devas, whom the best of men with
cherished love and choice sprinkle and serve with sacred
ghrta, who creates, shapes and rules the world of flying,
moving, non-moving and revolving objects and living
beings. That is Agni, Jataveda, self-refulgent and








O Jataveda, Agni, who abide and shine on top
of the world with the sun, with our thoughts, words and
holy songs we adore and worship you. You are adorable,
worthy of worship, pervasive all over heaven and earth.




6. Murdha bhuvo bhavati naktamagnistatah suryo


Agni as Vaishvanara is awake and vibrates as
the prime reality and spirit of existence at night when
the whole world sleeps. Then in the morning, rising with
the dawn, it shines as the sun. It is but the wondrous
work of the highest of adorables, cosmic Maya, that it
thus moves and vibrates at the fastest, knowing and
watching all actions and movements of the world of
moving and non-moving objects.






Wondrous in form, Agni, who, refulgent with


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 88 859


its own grandeur, shines in heaven as the light most
gracious is the divinity into whom, in sacred fire form,
all devas, divinities of nature and humanity, guardians
of our health and body, offer yajnic oblations of havi
with the chant of Vedic mantras.




8. Suktavakam prathamamddidagnimdiddhavira-


The devas, noble yajakas, first chant the divine
Word, then they light the fire and then they prepare and
offer the havi. That Agni is the adorable lord of them
all, guardian and promoter of health and age. That the
heaven receives, that the earth receives, and that the
waters receive, and that all of them realise, the pervasive
power and energiser.






Agni which all the divine powers of the universe
create and serve, into which all worlds of the universe
offer their oblations at the cosmic yajna of evolution
and devolution, that Agni, radiant and natural ordainer,
lights and energises this earth and heaven with its glory
and self refulgence.






10.  Stomena hi divi devaso agnimajijananchaktibhi


By mantric power and their own potential the
divine powers in heaven create and raise Agni which
pervades earth and sky too, thus creating it in three ways:
Agni or fire on earth, Vayu or electricity in the sky, and
Aditya or light in heaven. This same Agni of all universal
forms well matures and ripens herbs and all vegetation




11. Yadedenamadadhuryajniyaso divi devah surya-


When the divine powers, performers of cosmic
yajna, place this sun, child of the refulgence of Aditi,
mother Infinity, in the heavenly region, then it becomes
two, moving together as twofold power, Agni and
Vaishvanara, sun and dawn, and as they pervade all
regions of the world, so do all regions of the world see




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 88 861


12. Visvasma agnim bhuvanaya deva vaisvanaram


Devas, divine powers, create and make the solar
form of Vaishvanara Agni, and make it the flag sign of
the day for the sake of the whole world, and the sun,
radiating, lights up the bright dawns and dispels the
darkness of the night with its light, unveiling the day.




13. Vaisvanaram kavayo yajniyaso’ gnim deva ajana-


Wise and visionary Devas, adorable divine
powers, create the unaging Vaishvanara Agni, the
ancient star unalterable and inviolable, moving as the
ruling star of space, blazing and expansive.





With Vedic mantras we invoke and adore Agni,
Vaishvanara, light divine ever shining bright, the very
eye of omniscience which, with its might and grandeur,
enlightens and overwhelms both heaven and earth, the
ultimate light and bliss above and below, the end and
the foundation both.






15. Dve sruti asrnavam pitrnamaham devanamuta


I hear there are two paths of life in existence:
Pitryana, the path of average mortals to earthly bliss,
and Devayana, the path of divine souls to divine bliss.
By these does the world of vibrant life travel
transmigrating from birth by father and mother to death
and attains whatever is between earth and heaven.


16. Dve samict bibhratascarantam Sirsato jatam


Two, earth and heaven, together bear Agni born
on top, vibrant and radiating from the highest heaven,
and that abides immanent and pervasive all over the
worlds of existence, unremissive, radiant and divinely




10. Yatra vadete avarah parasca yajnanyoh kataro


Where both terrestrial agni and supraterrestrial


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 88 863


22111, both high priests of yajna, communicate and
commingle then, for us, which one of these excels and
proclaims the distinction? When yajakas do perform the
yajna and serve and celebrate Agni together on the vedi,
who would speak to us of the distinction?




18. Katyagnayah kati suryasah katyusasah katyu


How many are the fires? How many the suns?
How many the dawns? How many the waters? O
enlightened sages, I say this not out of curiosity, I ask
you this in all seriousness for the sake of knowledge.






As long as the all moving glorious Vayu, the
electric form of Agni, with radiant sun rays bears and
wears the face of dawn as its banner of the day, so long
would the holy yajaka, the Brahmana, go to the yajna
vedi and sit and offer the fragrant havi in honour of the
terrestrial fire, the high priest of yajna.


Note: The answer to these questions is given in
Rgveda 8, 58, 2: The same one Agni shines and blazes
in many forms, The same one sun shines in all lights of




the universe, the same one dawn rises over all this world,
and the same one lord of existence manifests in all forms
of the world,


Mandala 10/Sukta 89
Indra-Varunau Devate, Renu Vaishvamitra Rshi






Adore and celebrate Indra, highest over
humanity, who overwhelms the lights of the world with
his grandeur and rules over the ends of the earth, who,
watchful sustainer of humanity, pervades and fills the
worlds of the universe by his excellences and, all
overpowering, exceeds the oceans of earth and space
by his glory and grandeur.






the greatest, he moves the worlds of existence like
chariot wheels and, destroying the deepest darknesses
of the world with his refulgence, keeps the dynamic
universe in ceaseless flow like a particle in a wave of


MANDAL - 10/SUKTA - 89 865






3. Samanamasma anapavrdarca ksmaya divo


Worship Indra, constant, evident and immanent,
greater than heaven and earth, infinite, adorable ever
new, who, as primary foundation and ultimate master,
knows all that are born in existence and neither deserts
friends nor hurts the devotees.




4. Indraya giro atisitasarga apah prerayam saga-


I sing songs of praise and make incessant
streams of water flow from the oceans of space and sky
in honour of Indra who, with his cosmic power and
actions, sustains the heaven and earth in motion like
wheels of a chariot held in balance by the axle.








Boundless in passion and potential, impetuous
in action, mighty mover and shaker, awfully powerful,
strongly armed, simple and natural, creative and
inspiring like Soma, is Indra. Not all the winds and
weapons of the world, not all the lights and blazes, no
measures and comparisons of the finite world, can face,
equal, much less exceed and overcome Indra.




6. Na yasya dyavaprthivi na dhanva nantariksam


Neither heaven and earth, nor sky, nor space,
nor clouds and mountains, equal his might, creative and
inspiring Soma as he is, especially when his power and
passion, overwhelming all, shatters the strongest and
shakes the firmest fixed.






Destroying the demon of darkness like lightning
striking the woods, Indra shatters the strongholds of
evil. He breaks the clouds and mountains like a little


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 89 867


new earthen jar, and as he sets floods of rivers aflow, so
with his own waves of divine energy, he lets the streams
of psychic energy and spiritual enlightenment flow for
the devotee.




8. Tvam ha tyadrnaya indra dhiro ’sirna parva


You alone are the constant and magnificent giver
of bliss, and you alone, like the sword severing every
knot and joint of negativity, destroy the evil and
crookedness of life for those good people who do not
violate the light and law of Mitra and Varuna, universal
spirit of love, friendship and judgement and for those
who do not ever deceive a real sincere friend of all time.




9. Pra ye mitram pratyamanam durevah pra sam-


And against those crooked men of unholy ways
who deceive the friend, violate the progressive man of
justice and rectitude, hurt dedicated men of positive
social support and oppose the man of judgement and
enlightenment, O lord of power and progress, Indra,
prepare the thunderbolt, instant, overwhelming and
blazing but just and unquestionable, and strike such
unfriendly and negative forces without delay.








Indra rules over the heavens, Indra rules over
the earth, Indra rules over the waters of earth and space,
Indra rules over mountains and the clouds, and Indra
rules over all our actions and ambitions. And Indra is
the spirit and power for the rising wise on way to
progress in times of peace and prosperity to be invoked
and worshipped for protection and preservation of what
has been gained and for the achievement of that what
has yet to be gained further. (Yoga is achievement, and
Kshema is preservation and protection of what has been
achieved, and both these are two aspects of progress.)




11. Praktubhya indrah pra vrdho ahabyah prantari-


Indra is far greater than the nights of existence,
greater than days, space, and the bounds of space. He
transcends the expansive currents of energy, the bounds
of the universe, the flowing flux of existence, and all
definitions of the flux in form.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 89 869




12. Pra Sosucatya usaso na keturasinva te vartata-


Like the blazing flames of dawn dispelling the
dark, let your boundless thunderbolt strike. With that
blazing thunder, like a shot from heaven pierce the forces
of hate and enmity.




13. Anvaha masa anvidvananyanvosadhiranu parva-

Indeed, days and months, herbs and forests,
clouds and mountains, shining skies and earth and the


oceans and vapours of space, all move and proceed in
accordance with Indra as it emerges into manifestation.




14. Karhi svit sa ta indra cetyasadaghasya yadbhi-


Where is that punitive power of yours, Indra,
and when does it strike, the power that picks up and
shatters the sinner, the criminal, and the perpetrator of




evil, and struck by which the betrayers of friends, felled
and dead, lie on the ground like cattle carcasses.






15. Satriyanto abhi ye nastatasre mahi vradhanta


Enemies of humanity, obstructionist forces,
highly organised gangs which afflict us, may all
unfriendly forces suffer deep darkness on their way, and
may the powers of enlightenment and progressive
culture face them and overcome them.





May all felicitative yajnas of the people and holy
songs of celebrant seers adore and exalt you. O lord,
listening to this prayer and invocation, proclaiming your
acceptance and pleasure, come to all the devotees in
direct experience and bless them with peace and




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 90 871


17. Evate vayamindra bhunjinam vidyana sumatinam


of, experience and enjoy your protective, enlightening
and ever new gifts of kindness and grace. And may we,
being friends of the world, singing and celebrating your
divine gifts, know you and be happy by your favour
and protection day and night.



18. Sunari huvema maghavanamindramasmin bhare




We invoke and adore Indra, lord of bliss,
omnipotent, highest leader and guide of humanity in
this our battle of life for protection, victory and further
advancement. Indra is listening, blazing in battles,
destroying demons of darkness, negativity and
obstructions, and winning the honours, wealth and
excellences of the world for humanity.


Mandala 10/Sukta 90
Purusha Devata, Narayana Rshi






Purusha, the cosmic soul of existence, is
Divinity personified, of a thousand heads, a thousand
eyes and a thousand feet. It pervades the universe wholly
and entirely and, having pervaded and comprehended
the universe of ten Prakrtic constituents, It transcends
the world of existence.






All this that is and was and shall be is Purusha
ultimately, sovereign over immortality and ruler of what
expands by living food.

So great is the grandeur and glory of It, and still
the Purusha is greater. The entire worlds of existence
are but one fourth of It. Three parts of Its mystery are in
the transcendental heaven of immortality beyond the

4. Tripadurdhva udait purusah pado’syehabhavat


Three parts higher rises the Purusha above the


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 90 873


universe in which only one measure of Its glory
manifests again and again, pervading all the material
and biological world and thence remains transcendent
over the universe.




5. Tasmadvirdalajayata virajo adhi purusah.


From Purusha arose Virat, the cosmic idea, the
blue-print in terms of Prakrti. The Purusha manifests in
the Virat and remains sovereign over it. Though
manifested, it exceeds, transcends and then creates the
universe and the world regions for forms of existence.




6. Yat purusena havisa deva yajnamatanvata.


When the sages visualise the universal yajna of
creation and enact it in communion with the Purusha in
meditation, then the spring season is the ghrta, summer
is the fuel, and winter is the havi. (This meditative
enactment is in terms of nature. In fact, the creation of
the universe is an evolutionary process beginning with
Prakrti evolving into material, biological and psychic
forms as follows in this very hymn.)








The Rshis of universal vision, sages of universal
accomplishment and scholars of the Veda, invoke and
worship the eternal Purusha, self-manifested in advance
of every thing else of the cosmic yajna. They spread
and consecrate the grass over the vedi in mind and offer
the oblations in the cosmic fire with Veda mantras.



8. Tasmadyajnat sarvahutah sambhratam prsada-
yasca ye.

From that cosmic yajna with total input of
Prakrti, by the universal Purusha was prepared and
received the sacred ghrta, living plasma, the universal
material of creation. He created the animals, all those
birds of the air, rangers of the forest and inmates of the


0. Tasmadyajnat sarvahuta rcah samani jajnire.

From that Lord of universal yajna were born
the Rks and the Samans. From him were born the
Chhandas and from him were born the Yajus.



MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 90 875


10. Tasmadasva ajayanta ye ke cobhayadatah.


From that yajna were born the horses and those
which have two rows of teeth up and down. From that
were born the cows and from that were born the goat
and sheep.






How do the Rshis visualise the manifestive
modes of the Purusha? What was his mouth? What the
arms? What the thighs? What are the feet as they are
said to be?






The Brahmana, man of divine vision and the
Vedic Word, is the mouth of the Samrat Purusha, the
human community. Kshatriya, man of justice and polity,
is created as the arms of defence. The Vaishya, who
produces food and wealth for the society, is the thighs.
And the man of sustenance and ancillary support with
labour is the Shudra who bears the burden of the human
family as the legs bear the burden of the body.






13. Candrama manaso jatascaksoh suryo ajayata.


The moon is born of the cosmic mind, the sun
is born of the eye, the fire and energy is born from the
mouth and the wind is born from the breath.




14. Nabhya asidantariksam sirsno dyauh sama-


The sky was born of the navel of the cosmic
Purusha, that is, the sky is the navel part of the universe,
the heaven of light arose from the head, the earth
solidified from the dust of the feet, the space quarters
emanated from the ear, and the other regions of the
universe similarly arose from the Purusha.




15. Saptasyasan paridhayastrih sapta samidhah
sam pasum.


Seven are the bounds of the vedi of cosmic yajna
in meditation, thrice seven, twenty one, are the
samidhas, fuel sticks, ordained and offered into the yajna
fire. When the sages enact the yajna within, they
concentrate on the Purusha, the universal observer,
whose presence they crystallise and fix upon in the soul
for direct realisation.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 90 877


Note: In this mantra the word “‘pashu’ does not
mean ‘animal’ as has been interpreted by certain
translators. The word ‘pashw’ is derived from the root
‘pash’ which means ‘to see, to observe’. ‘Pashu’ then
means ‘one who sees’, and here it means the ‘Purusha,
cosmic observer’ whose presence is the object of
concentration in meditation.


Seven bounds and twenty one samidhas is the
mystique of meditative yajna of creation which has been
explained in different ways. Swami Dayanand explains
it thus in his commentary on Yajurveda, 31, 15:


Seven bounds are the seven chhandas, metrical
compositions of Veda mantras such as Gayatri. Twenty
one samidhas are: Prakrti, potential material cause of
the universe, Mahat, material cause actualised,
Ahankara, individualised identity of the universe which
may also be called the blue print of the universe, five
senses, and three qualitative orders of the creative
materials, i.e., Sattva (thought), Rajas (energy) and
Tamas (matter), and that makes up twenty one.


In the Introduction to his Commentary on the
Vedas Swami Dayanand explains the same thing in a
different and detailed manner in the chapter on creation.


For an average reader, a simpler way to
understand is to refer to the seven stages of creative
perceptive faculties, volition faculties, and gross
elements. These stages of evolution are the seven bounds
of creative yajnas performed by Purusha. They are also
samidhas because each successive evolute arises from




yajnic consumption of the preceding one. And each of
these seven is of three orders of quality, Sattva, Rajas
and Tamas. That makes it thrice seven.


Another way to realise the seven boundaries is
to refer to the seven Vyahrtis: Bhuh, Bhuvah, Svah,
Mahah, Janah, Tapah and Satyam which are the
boundaries of each loka or region of existence.




16. Yajnena yajnamayajanta devastani dharmani


By that yajna of the mind, and in meditative
realisation of the cosmic process of evolution, the sages
worship the master of cosmic yajna and realise the
eternal and original Dharmas of existence. Blest with
the light of the divine, they experience that heaven of
freedom which the primeval sages of the world enjoyed
at the dawn of creation.


In objective terms: Divine powers and potentials
by integration and interaction conduct and accomplish
the yajna of creation. They are the primary modes of
the laws and causes of creative evolution which, while
they wield and realise their potential in evolution, they
also embody and realise the heavenly purpose, the
original and efficient cause, the Purusha, and they are
also the same original and eternal potentials of divinity
which carry on the eternal cycle of existence.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 91 879


Mandala 10/Sukta 91
Agni Devata, Aruna Vaitahavya Rshi






Agni, celebrated by enlightened devotees, is
kindled and lighted in yajnic halls on the holy ground
on earth. Generous it is, loving and inspiring, universal
giver and receiver of yajnic materials and fragrances of
yajna, loving choice of all, all pervasive, refulgent, and
an unfailing friend who loves the devotees as friends
and is honoured by them as a friend.




2. Sa darsatasriratithirgrhegrhe vanevane Sisriye

Commanding excellent grace and grandeur,
honoured like a holy guest, it abides in every home and
every forest like a flying bird. Lover of humanity, it
loves every class of people and lives with all classes
and communities with equal love and favour.








Refulgent Agni, generous with immense gifts,
noblest performer by holy works, you are the omniscient
poetic creator evidently by your cosmic poetry of
existence. You alone dwell in the world as the highest
Vasu of life shelters and living forms, and you are the
master of all that the heaven and earth create and sustain.




4. Prajanannagne tava _yonimrtviyamilayaspade


Agni, lighted and refulgent, come and take your
holy seat in the vedi prepared and sprinkled with ghrta
according to the season on the floor of the yajnic earth.
The light and flames of your arrival shine and appear
like rise of the dawns, like rays of the sun, pure,




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 91 881




Your wonderful lustre and beauties shine like
lightning flashes of the clouds of rain, like lights of the
rising dawns, specially when, radiating warm and free,
you reach and shine upon the herbs and trees and fields
of grain and receive them into the shining warmth of
your maturing and ripening radiations.



6. Tamosadhirdadhire garbhamrtviyam tamapo




That Agni, energy, the herbs and waters receive
into them and they bear it as mothers, producing it on
maturity as nourishment and energy for life forms. The
same Agni, the herbs and trees of the forest receive
equally, hold it in the womb and always produce it as
the embodiment of energy.







When urged and impelled by wind, Agni, you




rush fast to objects of your choice love and consumption,
then your youthful unaging flames, burning and blazing,
rush on like the horses of a monarch’s chariot.




8. Medhakaram vidathasya prasadhanamagnim


Devotees choose to worship Agni alone, none
other than Agni, giver of intelligence, accomplisher of
yajna and education for knowledge, high priest of yajnic
existence, supreme over all, omniscient wise, and
equally loving for all, whether the havi offered is small
or great, whether the purpose is high or low. O lord of




9. Tvamidatra vrnate tvayavo hotaramagne vida-


Agni, here in the world, your loving devotees,
wise sages, thoughtful people, choose to worship you,
high priest of yajna, when dedicated to divinity and the
divine potentials of nature, having spread the holy grass
on the vedi and bearing sacred havi, they offer their
dearest fragrant oblations to you.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 91 883




10. Tavagne hotram tava potramrtviyam tava

Agni, you are the over all master and lord of
yajna, yours are all the functions: you are the yajaka,
you are the purifier, you are the leader, you are the
kindler, you are the director, you are the manager, you
are the Brahma, presiding priest, and you are the chief
of our yajnic home.




11. Yastubhyamagne amrtaya martyah samidha


Agni, whoever the mortal that gives unto you,
Spirit imperishable, Lord immortal, and surrenders
himself by way of fuel fire, dedicates his total life as
yajnic performance, you yourself become the yajaka for
him, move as his messenger, speak to him in the soul,
and take over his life itself as manager of the yajna.
(Surrender, O man, to the Immortal for the sake of

13. Imam pratnaya sustutim naviyasim voceyamasma


Let me raise this new holy song of praise to the
loving and gracious eternal Agni. May the Lord listen.
And let it be like an inspiring creative poem full of love
and passion in a beautiful form for the master, able to
touch and move his heart within to bless me.




14. Yasminnasvasa rsabhasa uksano vasa mesa


With love and devotion at heart I create this song
of thoughtful praise for the kind and gracious Agni under
whose order and dispensation horses, virile bulls, cows,


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 92 885


sheep and goats are created and range around freely
and then are called back to the stalls.




15. Ahavyagne havirasye te sruciva ghrtam camviva


Agni, fragrant havi is offered into the sacred
fire as ghrta in the ladle and soma in the cup. Pray bear
and bring us rising prosperity with food, sustenance and
victory, wealth, noble progeny, and honour and glory
of the noblest order.


Mandala 10/Sukta 92
Vishvedevah Devatah, Sharyata Manava Rshi






Honour and adore Agni, leader of your life’s
yajna, ruler and sustainer of communities of the people,
pioneer and chief priest of the universe, useful giver of
the peace of night, and spectrum light of the world.
Generous and virile, brilliant illuminator, worthy of
honour and adoration, burning the dry woods and
vibrating in the greens it pervades every thing on earth
and reposes in the regions of light.






2. Imamanjaspamubhaye akrnvata dharmanama-


Both humans and divines honour and adore this
Agni, by nature energising life constantly, sustainer of
the world and its dharma, accomplisher of yajna. They
love and adore it like the mighty sun, harbinger of the
dawn and child inviolable of the blazing cosmic energy.






Truly do we love and adore the various gifts of
this Agni. May the food, energy and sustenance, all with
light divine, blessed gifts, be good for consumption and
advancement. Indeed, when relentless devotees come
to realise the imperishable joy and freedom of
immortality, then are the gifts of this divine Agni truly
realised in actuality.




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 92 887


4. Rtasya hi prasitirdyaururu vyaco namo mahyara-


All this existence is an extension, a web, of
nature and her law under the ordinance of Agni: the
heavens of light, the vast skies, adorable earth,
expansive space, all are but fragrant manifestations of
Agni, the cosmic high priest. Mitra, the sun, Varuna,
the night, Bhaga, cosmic power, Savita, cosmic
creativity, all reveal the omnipotence of the generous
lord of light and purity that gives everything in plenty.
They all do homage to Agni.






Showers of rain and floods of rivers which cover
the earth move by the tempestuous currents of cosmic
energy of the Maruts, and by the same currents the vast
ocean of vapours far traversing across the middle
regions roars in the womb of skies and showers and
fertilises the world of life.



6. Krana rudra maruto visvakrstayo divah syenaso






Active currents of the cosmic energy of the
Maruts, dwelling all over the universe, move from the
regions of the sun as directed companions of the ocean
of vapours, and along with those dynamic currents are
seen the dynamic Varuna, Mitra, Aryama and Indra,
forces of nature’s catalysis, integration, direction and






Indra, cosmic energy, is self-potent, creative and
immensely fertile. In Indra, in its splendid self-
manifestive power to be observed and pursued with the
mind, they find possibilities of human profit, and they,
creative and competent craftsmen in elite human
institutions, invent usable instruments of power,
prosperity and protection.




8. Surascida harito asya riramadindrada kascidbha-


Even the sun radiates its rays of light under the
power and law of Indra, supreme omnipotent. Every
powerful force obeys the law and power of Indra. Under
the power of fertile and potent Indra, the whistling winds


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 92 889


blow from its vault and the mighty cloud roars without
obstruction day by day.






Offer now a song of praise and adoration with
homage to Rudra, mighty lord of justice and
dispensation, leader, protector and ruler of the brave,
self-existent, self-glorious, lover of peace and well
being, commanding bright power and forces moving
on their ordered course by which he blesses loving
devotees with the fulfilment of their cherished desires.






They for sure hold and know the evolution of
life, birth of divinity’s children: Brhaspati, lord of Prakrti
and the Word of knowledge, Vrshabha, generator of the
seed of life in the form of Hiranyagarbha, and the Soma
currents of vitality which bear the seeds in life form.
These, first Atharvan holds in knowledge and
disseminates in form and word by processes of yajna,
and later, the divine Bhrgus, sages of knowledge and




austere discipline, acquire the knowledge by tradition
and their own expertise.




11. Te hi dyavaprthivi bhuriretasa narasamsascatu-


These for sure are the divinities which contribute
to the evolution and flow of life : the solar region and
the earth both replete with life and fertility, the middle
region which overflows with electric energy, air, vapour,
and elements of nourishment, evolutionary law in its
which is the formative power immensely generous and
keen to structure the forms, pranic energy, wind energy,
and Vishnu, divine power of sustenance. These are
powers worthy of our gratitude, reverence and worship.






And may that Ahirbudhnya, omnipresent,
omniscient and all watching lord of expansive Prakrti,
listen to our profuse prayer and adoration offered in
our yajna with unbounded love and faith. And may the
sun and moon, both stationed in heaven and moving in

natural perception, and may the heaven and earth too

nourishment, protect and promote our living and moving
wealth. May the life-giving Vayu energy, sustainer of

being. O dedicated celebrants of divinity, honour and
adore the glorious spiritual energy within the soul, and
may the Ashvins, complementary currents of natural life
energy in yajnic touch with us, perceive our earnestness
on way and bring us blessings of divinity.




14. Visamasamabhayanamadhiksitam girbhiru


With songs of praise we celebrate Agni, ruling

Great is Indra, cosmic energy, great is the joy of

energy circuit. Grand, not easy, is the knowledge and
articulation of the divine energy of nature, and its
management too at the human level as yajnic process is

Savita, O lord of light and life’s creativity,
admired and exalted by the strong and powerful, pray
make us bold and self-confident, let us never be
subjected to shame and ignominy. Indra, lord of power,
controls and directs the power and wisdom of these
people of the earth with psychic currents of pranic
energies as a driver controls and directs the movement
of the chariot by reins and the wheels.






O earth and heaven, mother and father of
humanity, pray vest high honour and fame of universal

the Word from the sages who speak for us. You too, O
yajakas, speak the Word when the sages of eminent


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 94 899


standing, bearers of soma, together passionately offer
the words of divine praise to Indra.






The sages speak as they do to hundreds and
thousands, and proclaim the Word loud and bold with
resounding voice. Eloquent sages of long standing,
noble performers, sitting on the vedi, speak with noble
tongue in sacred language and partake of the yajnic
hospitality of the yajamana.




They speak only when they know the subject
by experience, having tasted with relish the honey
sweets of the juice in the ripe fruit. Enjoying the fruit of
life on the bright branch of the tree of existence they,
mighty wise, bearing the knowledge by experience in
the mind, speak the word of wisdom and reveal the truth.






4. Brhadvadanti madirena mandinendre kro-


They speak wide and bold, exalt Indra with joy
in words of ecstasy, tasting, knowing and proclaiming
sweets of honey by music of the tongue. Having
experienced and enjoyed the taste of sweetness
repeatedly, the veterans express the ecstasy in dance
with gestures, movements and expressions, the earth
resounding with the music of their joy.





Birds of imagination fly up to the bounds of
heaven and raise their voice of adoration, vibrant clouds
dance in the deepest caverns of space and celebrate their
joy, the spirits distil the ecstasy of highest realisation
and, pure and radiant as sunlight, receive profuse
showers of immortal life.



6. Ugra iva pravahantah samayamuh sakam yukta


Like virile bulls yoked together bearing the

chariot pole and drawing the chariot forward, they,
inspired and mighty enthusiastic, lead humanity
pleasure and pain of social experience, they go on
proclaiming their message, and the echoes of their
proclamation is heard like the breathing of victorious




7. Dasavanibhyo dasakaksyebhyo dasayoktrebhyo


Honour those who work at ten levels of earthly
life and create the soma joy of existence, ten equal
cooperators like the ten fingers, ten equal cooperative
faculties such as the senses, ten possible cooperatives
such as energies of passion and understanding, ten
partners such as the pranic energies, ten dynamic forces
such as will and determination, ten unaging ones such
as desires and ambitions, ten burden bearers joined to
carry on the tenfold business of living such as the rules
of personal and social discipline.



8. Te adrayo dasayantrasa asavastesamadhanam






They are the sages and scholars strong as
with tenfold discipline and freedom of mind, fast and
instant workers and thinkers whose total energy and
attention is concentrated on the one central end and aim
of life: the creation of joy. And they alone share and
enjoy the first, original and immortal nectar sweet of
the blissful energy and ecstasy of life created and refined
by sages.




0. Te somado hari indrasya nimsatem’ sum duhanto


They, tasting of soma joy, attain to both
knowledge and action toward both secular and sacred
aims of life under divine dispensation and, distilling
the joy of life, abide confident in the state of yoga on
the earth and then on higher planes as well. Indra, the
soul, drinking of the honey sweet milk of divine ecstasy,
rises, expands and expresses itself in showers of creative
joy and positive activity.

O veteran sages, parental lovers of humanity,

13. Tadidvadantyadrayo vimocane yamannanjaspa


Veteran sages on way to freedom from the bonds
of mortality speak of immortal Indra like bards in a state
of ecstasy. As the farmer, having sowed the corn, guards
it till ripeness, they, enjoying the soma experience, guard
and mature the nectar, they do not violate it, never
destroy the taste of immortality.




14. Sute adhvare adhi vacamakratakrilayo na mata-


Just as children in love vex the mother while
playing, so when the yajna is on and soma is extracted,
let the sages recite the hymns with love and a sense of
freedom and release in spontaneity and then let them
retire with love and reverence into rest and silence.


Mandala 10/Sukta 95


Devata: Urvashi (1, 3, 6, 8-10, 12, 14, 17), Pururava (2,

10, 12, 14, 17), Urvashi (2, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18)


(This sukta is a dialogue between Pururava, the


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 95 905
man, and Urvashi, the consort.)






awhile with mind at ease. Let us have a dialogue between
us, words of mutual interest, of love and sweetness.
These words and thoughts have remained unexpressed
between us. Will they not do some good to us some
later day?





What shall we do with these words of yours? I
am yours but I go like mist of the morning before dawn.
Go back to your abode, Pururava, I am unattainable,
elusive like the winds.






I am not able to shoot the arrow from the quiver




for victory and glory, and though I am strong and brave,
I cannot win the hundreds of lands with the roar of
victory. O lady bereft of the brave, I shine not in the
rising battles of life, my own powerful forces forsake
me;


man in love with life and the search for inspiration,
purpose and consummation of living. The love is
intense, excessive and vociferous like the thundering
cloud’s and the inspiration is lovely and seductive like
the elusive lightning. It can be interpreted as a dialogue
between the ambitious ruler and the social power, and
ultimately, between the liver (man) and the possibilities
of life, the passion and the unattainable, the dawn and
the day, the night and the morrow.)


Note that Pururava is Aila, child of Ila, nature,
and Urvashi is infinite beauty, and their consummation
is joy and creativity.




4. Sa vasu dadhti Svasuraya vaya uso yadi vastya-


If Urvashi (electric energy or the dawn) bearing
light and nourishment for the coming day were to rise
from the depth of space or darkness of night, and
stricken with love as catalytic agent, were to visit the
lover’s chamber, the heart of the cloud or the sun on the
rise, then she would be struck with three way charge of
positive, negative and consummative ‘vaitasa’, process


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 95 907


of nature’s evolutionary activity. Day and night, all time?


(‘Vaitasa’ is the name of a process of movement,
consumption and evolution in the natural cycle. The
catalytic agent does not stay with the mode it causes to
change and move toward growth. The electric charge
causes the cloud thunder, breaks the cloud into rain,
and that causes the earth to produce vegetation. The
processes of catalysation, rain and growth are described
in the Brahmanas and quoted by Swami Dayananda in






O Pururava, cloud, day, thrice in a unit of time
you would move me with the energy of procreative
nature and thus achieve the fulfilment of nature’s
purpose. Come to your chamber thus for fulfilment, O
brave one, you would be the ruler of my body. (But stay

Mantras 4 and 5 are spoken by Urvashi like a



6. Ya sujurnih srenih sumnapirhradecaksurna gran-




Waves of energy flow, exciting, wavy, soothing,
successive and cyclic, and move in circuit, beautiful,
shining red rays, harbingers of beauty and prosperity
like young loving cows of the family.






When this roaring cloud is formed or when the
sun is risen for the day, then many forces like divine
consorts of nature join and, self-energised and fluent
like showers of rain and streams of water, exalt it. O
Pururava, then the devas too, brilliant divinities of nature
and humanity, prepare and exalt you for the mighty battle
against want and darkness to destroy evil from nature
and society.


(The metaphor of natural forces here may be
said to touch the field of human society. Many divine,
natural and human forces join in the wedding of the
young man and in the investiture of the ruler in his office.
Both are like the cloud formed for showers and like the
sun risen for the day, and the function of both is to dispel
want and darkness from nature and society.)


8. Saca yadasu jahatisvatkamamanusisu manuso




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 95 909


When Pururava, the mighty cloud, takes over
earthly form and joins the unearthly forms of nature
character, they, which earlier had feared him like the
game fearing the hunter, do not fear him as horses joined
to the chariot do not fear the master.


When the mortal Puruava loving these immortal
beings joins them with loving words as well as with
noble actions, then they, like swans playing in water,


shine and show their bodies like horses playing with
the bridle in their teeth.



10. Vidyunna ya patanti davidyodbharanti me apya

Like lightning, falling and flashing, bringing me
cherished gifts of water showers, Urvashi who creates
blissful floods and streams for humanity blesses me with
long life and health.





11.  Jajnisa ittha gopithyaya hi dadhatha tat pururavo


Pururava, you are born and destined for the
protection of earth and promotion of life. Pray bear and
command the lustre of life for me. Educated and cultured
in the art of home life, I advised you day in and day out,
pray listen to me. What can you say if you do not serve
life and mother earth? Nothing.




12. Kada sunuh pitaram jata icchaccakranasru


When would the progeny born, grown, knowing
and coming without tears and actively doing love and
favour the parents? And who would separate the couple
wedded in mutual love when the passion for life shines
among the brave? None.


13. Prati bravani vartayate asru cakran na kranda-




And I say to you, Pururava, by way of warning:
if the untoward happens in case of separation, the child
would come to you crying, in tears, yearning for


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 95 911


consolation and comfort. I would send him to you who
is now ours and spurn you off: O fool, impetuous,
infructuous man, go off your way, I am not for you!



14. Sudevo adya prapatedanavrt paravatam para-


Urvashi, if such a calamity befall, let the ardent
lover immediately fall to no redemption, go far to the
farthest distance, let him lie in the depth of denial and
adversity, and let voracious wolves devour him.



15. Pururavo ma mrtha ma pra papto ma tva vrkaso


Pururava, let this never be: do not die, never
fall, never must cursed wolves devour you, such are
not the loves and friendships of women. It is only women
of wolfish heart that deceive and betray the covenant.




16. Yadvirupadcaram martyesvavasam ratrihsarada-


When I came down from the divine into this




different earthly form living happily for four years
among mortals, I have lived on one time little drop of
ghrta a day, and content with that alone I sojourn among
men.




17. Antarisapram rajaso vimanimupa Siksamyur-


I, Vasishtha, closest ardent lover, speak to
Urvashi, spirit of boundless beauty, light and love, and
celebrate this ranger of the skies, controller of vapours
and breaker of the cloud. May the bounty of divine
generosity ever abide by you. My heart is burning, pray
turn, return and fulfil the divine purpose.




18. Iti tva deva ima ahuraila yathemetadbhavasi


Pururava Aila, child of nature, word of divinity,
this is what the divines have spoken: Kinsman of death
you would be, your children would serve the divinities
with homage and fragrant havi into the yajna fire, and
you too would abide in paradise and be happy.


(This sukta is a myth, a mystery, until it is


It is a myth of the love between man and woman,


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 96 913


fickle as well as unbreakable and sacred. The flower
and fruit of it is the child, continuance of the race. And
it may be called the myth of Purusha and Prakrti and
the cycle of existence. It is a myth of the cloud, thunder
and lightning. The cloud is a mass of gases, then the
electric charge, thunder, lightning, rain and life on earth.
And it points to a wonder possibility:


The thunderous cloud, Pururava, is ineffective
without Urvashi, the lightning charge. Urvashi, the
heavenly nymph, lives on one drop of ghrta per day.
The children of the couple live and perform yajna, and
the parents abide in paradise. Can we say: One drop of
ghrta into the yajna fire per day feeds Urvashi which
causes the cloud to rain and the yajaka contributes to a
life of paradise on earth?

Hari Devata, Baru Angirasa or Sarvahari Aindra Rshi






O lord omnipotent, Hari, in your great cosmic
yajna, I adore your forces of Rtam and Satyam. Lord of
beauty, glory and bliss, I pray for the joy of your ecstatic
bliss, which, beautiful and beatific with showers of joy,
blesses life on earth as ghrta exalts the sacred fire. May
our words of adoration and prayer reach your blissful
presence immanent in the universe.






2. Harim hi yonimabhi ye samasvaran hinvanto hari


You, who in concert adore and exalt Hari,
omnipotent original cause of the universe as he pervades
the divine spatial home, whom hymns of Veda and rays
of the sun please and fulfil with their vibrations and
radiations as cows fulfil the yajna with ghrta and milk,
whose powers of Rtam and Satyam with their centrifugal
and centripetal forces you praise, please study and
honour that power of his which bears the burden of the
world of nature and humanity. Do so for the sake of the
honour and excellence of life on the way forward.




2. So asya vajro harito ya ayaso harirnikamo harira


That power of Hari, omnipotent Indra, is the
thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is electric, magnetic,
unfailing in aim and desire and it is borne in the hands
of centrifugal and centripetal forces. It is bright and
blazing, mighty passionate, punitive and destructive for
the evil. Indeed in Indra as in the sun, all forms, all
colours and all beauties are integrated.

Indra, lord of light and knowledge, self-
manifested universal spirit of light, love and beauty,
loved and adored by the earliest celebrant sages, you
alone received, acknowledged and blest the adorations
of the past, and you alone are the sole, unique, beloved,
universally adorable giver of success and fulfilment who
love, receive, acknowledge and bless the gifts of
adoration and yajna offered to you.

Those adorable carriers, centrifugal and
centripetal forces of divine nature, bear and sustain the
power and presence of the thunder armed, joyous,
adorable Indra in the divine blissful chariot as the
universe of existence. For this Indra, blissful lord, many
yajna sessions, soma oblations and beautiful gifts of
homage are prepared and offered.




7. Aram kamaya harayo dadhnvire sthiraya hinvan


The dynamics of divine nature sustain the
refulgent Indra for its holy solar purpose. The same
powers energise the gravitational forces to hold the sun
in balanced orbit. By these energy forces does Indra’s
presence vibrate in the universe with love. And through

radiation enters waters of the earth and vapours of space,
he expands in power and presence, and with powers of
instant radiation, he shines as lord of abundant earth
and overcomes all evils of disease and darkness with






His golden eyes, sun and moon, move and
radiate light as two ladles of ghrta feed and exalt the

Indra, lord of light divine and solar radiations,
you have drunk of the soma of the ancients of earliest
sessions. This yajna session and the soma extracted in

Let me observe, investigate and know the herbs,
ancient and best for all the three seasons and ages, born

places where they grow and where they work. (‘Shatam
hundred herbs and the places where they grow.)








O mother herb, hundreds are the places where

parna tree, you share your efficacy with the earth, sun
rays and the cow by which you bestow health and vitality

Where herbs and medicines concentre as ruling

Mandala 10/Sukta 98
Devah Devata, Devapi Arshtishena Rshi


I Brhaspate prati me devatamihi mitro va yadva-


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 98 927


Brhaspati, lord of unbounded rain and thunder,
come and bless me as the epitome of divine powers,
whether you are Mitra or Varuna or Pusha or commander
of the Marut winds with Adityas and Vasus. Let the cloud
rain for the man of peace and lover of knowledge.


(This mantra is a prayer for physical as well as
for spiritual rain of water and peace for the lover of
knowledge and peace. Brhaspati, Mitra, Varuna and
other devas are physical powers of rain, and this process
of vapourisation, electric catalysis of gases and
condensation has been explained in his essays on the
composition of water and atmosphere by late Pandit
Gurudatta Viyarthi in his book Wisdom of the Rshis,
republished by Dr. Ravi Prakash Arya, Email :




May the divine messenger, fast and brilliant,
harbinger of collected light of knowledge come to me.

Brhaspati, come to me constantly and continuously in


my mind and speech.








Infinite lord of nature, knowledge and the divine
word, bring us for our mind and speech illuminant
shower of the divine voice, immaculate, unrestrained
and inspiringly energetic by which we may bring about
an earthly rain of peace and enlightenment for the lover
of knowledge and well being for all, and let a shower
of paradisal honey sweets bless the earth from heaven.




4. Ano drapsa madhumanto visantvindra dehyadhi-


Let showers of honey bless us, Indra, give us a
thousandfold wealth of peace and prosperity of high
order. O harbinger of Devas, sit on the vedi, perform
the yajna according to the seasons and serve the
divinities with oblations of havi as required for the





Arshtishena Devapi, sagely seer knowing the
dynamics of yajnic creation and the qualities and
functioning of different divine facts of nature and life


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 98 929


in full knowledge of the moods of beneficent divinities,
may seat himself on the vedi of yajna, create clouds of
divine water in the vast sky above and bring down
showers from the ocean above to the earth for fields,
rivers and the seas.




6. Asmintsamudre adhyuttarasminnapo devebhir-


In this upper oceanic sky water vapours stay held
up by divine forces of nature. Catalised by electric
charge caused by divine marut energies, they condense,
and, sent down into clouds, they shower, upon the earth
in torrents.






When Devapi, friend of divinities, the priest
appointed for the purpose of rain yajna, prays and shines
with adoration, Brhaspati, listening to his prayer to
divinity for rain, waxes with joy and grants him the gift
of thunderous Word and shower for the peace and
prosperity of humanity.






8. Yam tva devapih susucano agna arstiseno manu-


Agni, whom Devapi, priest and sagely scholar
of the science of rain, shining with ardent adoration
among men, lights and serves with sacred fire and
prayer, be pleased along with all the divine powers and
move the clouds laden with rain showers for humanity.




9. Tvam purva rsayo girbhirayan tvamadhvaresu


Agni, universally invoked and adored yajnic
power and showers of rain, saints and seers of the world
of all time approached you with songs of adoration and
prayer in yajna. O lord of red flames and thunderous
voice, pray visit our yajna and grant us a thousandfold
gifts overflowing our chariots of life.




10. Etanyagne navatirnava tve ahutanyadhiratha


Agni, these ninety and nine chariots of life laden
with overfulls of a thousand gifts of homage are offered
to you. With these, O Lord Almighty, rise in flames of
glory and grace and, thus loved and adorned, pray move
the eternal showers of bliss for us from the light of


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 98 931
heaven.




11. Etanyagne navatim sahasra sam pra yaccha vrsna


Agni, these ninety and nine thousand gifts of
homage, pray, send up to Indra, generous lord of
showers, for our share of his divine service and, knowing
the paths of the divine movements of nature according
to seasons, put the clusters of vapour in heaven among
the divinities, Maruts, Mitra, Varuna and others for
showers of rain.


(‘Aulana’ may also be interpreted as the devout
human soul and ‘showers’ as showers of divine bliss.)




12. Agne badhasva vi mrdho vi durgahapamivam-apa


Agni, drive away the violent, open up the
impassables, eliminate ill health and disease, repel and
destroy the evil, and from that infinite ocean of the
waters of life, release the showers of heavenly bliss on
earth for us.




Mandala 10/Sukta 99
Indra Devata, Vamra Vaikhanasa Rshi




1. Kam nascitramisanyasi cikitvan prthugmanam


comfort and well being, gifts wondrous and varied,
expansive and admirable, for our progress and
advancement. Great is his gift of bliss, the mighty one,
for our fulfilment. And what could be our gift in return
for his kindness? He creates and wields the thunder for
breaking the cloud and strikes the thunderbolt to destroy
the evil, and he gives us the showers that we may grow
and rise in life.






He, challenger of adversaries and destroyer of
suffering and violence, goes on with light and lightning,
pervades the vast space, and rules and breaks the mighty
clouds with his kindred Maruts. Such is the power and
splendour of the ruler and sustainer of the highest


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 99 933



2. Sa vajam yatapaduspada yantsvarsata pari sadat


He goes on with the dynamics of existence by
straight unfailing paths of law and rectitude, giving
showers of joy, presiding over it all, keen to share it
with one and all, irresistible and unhurting, opening a
hundred doors of possibility for wealth and excellence,
and subduing the demons of lust and impiety with force,
the one supreme ruling power.




4. Sa yahvyo’vanirgosvarvajuhoti pradhanyasu


That mighty Indra, moving, flowing and
advancing, showers torrents of rain over fertile lands
where fast and deep streams, cooperative friends of
Indra, receive and make the precious waters move of
themselves by gravity, without external aids such as legs
and chariots.


(In the third and fourth mantras, Indra may be
interpreted as human soul in the context of yoga
meditation and control over mind and senses. In this
context, the flow would mean the flow of consciousness.
In the physical sense Indra may be interpreted as Vayu,




the catalytic electric energy that breaks the clouds of
vapour into showers of rain. Indra as the supreme cosmic
power that rules and sustains the world of existence, of
course, is obvious throughout the hymn.)




5. Sa rudrebhirasastavara rbhva hitvi gayamare


That Indra, mighty energy, free from despicables
and undesirables, and possessed of indescribable wealth
of force, moves with Rudras, catalytic forces, in serial
motion leaving one place for another and, I believe, it
gets to the gaseous couple that produce and deliver the
waters, and having broken the cloud and taken away
the waters, food of life, leaves it roaring.




6. Sa iddasam tuviravam patirdan salaksam trisir-


That Indra, sustainer of life, attacking the six-
eyed three-headed cloud, subdues it, and Trita, threefold
Agni power, rising by the power and lustre of Indra,
with currents sharp as razor’s edge, breaks the cloud
and delivers the rain.


(The cloud is six eyed because it is active and
awake all the six seasons of the year. It is three headed


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 99 935


because it arises from three regions: from the solar
region as soma, from the middle regions as parjanya
and from the earthly region as water vapour.


Agni is threefold, Trita, because it has three
varieties of its form and function: terrestrial fire as agni,
middle region vayu or electric energy, and solar region
aditya or light, and all of them play their part in the
formation of the cloud in the form of water vapour on
earth, parjanya in the middle region and soma in the
solar region.)






Indra, lord supreme, highest potent, best and
foremost leader among humanity committed to truth and
right and controller of the lawless and violent, strikes
the weapon of justice and punishment against the forces
of jealousy, enmity and destruction and, risen to nobility
and grandeur of personality in his own right, deserving
the highest position, destroys the strongholds of
negativity in our struggle against anti-social and anti-




8. So abhriyo na yavasa udanyan ksayaya gatum




Just as the cloud waxing with water vapours
goes down in showers on earth for the nourishment of
fields and pastures, so does Indra, ruling soul,
overflowing with generosity, goes forward to the earth
for our peaceful home life and with the iron spur of his
heels strikes and drives away the evils around us, since
he, a tempestuous soul in body like the eagle, sits close
to the Indu, blissful source of the nectar of life.






He throws off the violent with his powerful
forces, he removes drought and adversity, and he thereby
gives strength and confidence to the supplicant devotee.
He leads that man of vision and imagination to the
heights of fame and admiration who, of all men, knows
his real form and nature and in his spirit realises his


10. Ayam dasasyan naryebhirasya dasmo devebhir-
He, generous giver of favours by the dynamics


of his divine powers, gracious and wondrous like
Varuna, cosmic spirit of justice and retribution, throws


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 99 937


off evil, violence and negativity. He is known as gentle
and kind, protector and ordainer of the seasons of the
world and, existent in four states of cosmic being,
overcomes jealousy and aggression.



11. Asya stomebhirausSija rjisva vrajam darayadvr-


When the simple, natural and ardent yajaka,
having prepared the soma of adoration, shines with his
words of praise, then, crossing the physical, pranic,
mental and intellectual covers of the soul’s existential
state, and breaking into the secret cave of the soul’s
divinity by the showers of the grace of the lord giver of
life and spiritual strength, he becomes established in
his essential nature and shines in his natural spiritual




12. Eva maho asura vaksathaya vamrakah padbhi-

Thus, O lord of life and pranic energy of the
universe, the humble devotee bursting forth in song and
adoration step by step moves on to you, great burden
bearer and ordainer of the universe. Thus does the lord




revealing the presence does good to this devotee giving
him all the world’s wealth of food, energy, peace and
shelter of divinity and shines to him in full glory.

Reflected in yajna, power of thought and meditation,
holiness of intelligence, you are our sustainer as father
giver of happiness. We honour and adore Aditi,

We honour and adore Aditi, mother Infinity of universal

O Devas, generous divinities of nature and
humanity, O Vasus, givers of peace and settlement at

open or covert toward you, never incur the displeasure

thought, word and deed. We honour and adore the
universal imperishable mother spirit of divine nature.




8. Apamivam savita savisannyagvariya idapa


May Savita, self-refulgent light of the world,
ward off and destroy all pollution and disease. May the
wise, like clouds and mountains, stall and wash off even

and imperishable wisdom and purity of divinity.

For the person dedicated to him, serving him

Indra who, like the sun of radiant and expansive

mysterious and sublime like the expansive space and






8. Ava no vrjina Ssisthyrca vanemanrcah.


Reduce and remove our sin and crookedness.
Let us win over the negationists with hymns of positive
celebration of nature and divinity. Yajna, pursuit of

Your Trinity of divine glory and power rising

Prakrti and Jiva, the soul, which pervades the threefold

thought, which pervades the three worlds of heaven,
earth and the skies, which activates divine stuti,

Ashvins, like mighty fast and illustrious pilots,

Divine fulfilment and yajnic dakshina for the

shame, they give for the fulfilment of the deserving holy

mantras of Aum, three branches of Veda, Rk, Yajuh and
Sama, three orders of yajnic fire, Agni, Vayu and Aditya,
and who has first fulfilled the basic part and pre-requisite

He who gives a horse as dakshina, who gives a
cow, who gives silver, who gives gold, gives food and
food grains, that giver is our own, the very soul of yajna

Mandala 10/Sukta 108
Devata: Sarama (7, 3, 5, 7, 9), Panayah (2, 4, 6, 8, 10,

This sukta is a dialogue between the Panis who
are also Asuras, and Sarama. At the physical level the
Panis are the dark clouds of vapours, and Sarama is
thunder and lightning. At the spiritual, the Panis are the
senses and pranas and Sarama is the energy of the spirit,
the soul’s urge for living, elan vital or Ashish.






What does she want? Sarama, thunder voice of


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 108 979


divinities, that is come here? The path which the higher
ones tread is far off, not here. And what is our interest
here in her coming? How deep is the darkness like the
unfathomable night! How has she crossed the floods of
the skies. (This is what the Panis say in response to




2. Indrasya dutirisita carami maha icchanti panayo


Sarama: O clouds, O pranic energies, I am the
dynamic spirit of Indra, inspired by Indra, I sojourn here,
anxious to take on the treasures and pleasures of your
living possibilties. I wander from the boundless force
of Indra, and I wander with fear. May Indra protect us.
That’s how I have crossed the floods of water and the
golden greens of Indra’s court.






Panis: O Sarama, voice of thunder and lightning,
O dynamic spirit of life, what sort is this Indra? What is
his strength and splendour whose messenger you come
travelling from far, whom we should receive as a friend




and bear as one that he may be our master and the master
of our cows, our powers and potentials for living?




4. Naham tam veda dabhyam dadhat sa yasyedam


Sarama: O Panis, O clouds, O senses and pranic
powers of practical living, I do not comprehend that
power, Indra, which is undaunted, which is
overpowering, whose messenger I am, come from afar.
Mighty rolling oceans of unfathomable depth cannot
cover it, nor contain it. Indeed, struck by Indra, the
clouds fall in showers and lie on the ground.





Panis: O noble and glorious Sarama, these
streams of rain, these vibrations of senses, mind and
energies which you want, travelling unto the bounds of
heaven, who would release these for you without
struggle? And our weapons too are sharp and powerful.




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 108 981


6. Asenya vah panayo vacasyanisavyastanvah santu


Sarama: O Panis, clouds of vapour, mind and
sense vibrations, your words are not worthy of fight,
your bodies are too tenuous for the arrows, your path of
motion too is not strong enough for any campaign. And
even Brhaspati, lord of speech and space, himself would
not be too indulgent toward you. You are too lost in the
dust around to be free from sin.






Panis: O Sarama, light of lightning, spirit of
life’s will, this treasure is locked in the cloud, it is vibrant
with sunlight within, lustre of nature and wealths of
life. And that treasure, practical possibilities guard.
Wonderful guards are they. In vain have you come to
this place, it is void of anything for you.

Sarama: O Panis, calculative clouds of small
gain, here come the sharpest shears of wind, stormy
gusts of winds, sudden whirl winds, which all will




shatter this concentration of waves and vapours of living
possibilities of the rains of life, (render them
meaningless and purposeless without the presence of
Indra, the soul). Mind therefore, and withdraw those

glorious sister, pray do not go back, we share the waves

sisterhood. Indra and fiery winds and energies of
nature’s law know what is to be known. Those who want
to live by senses and pranas, the source whence I come,
would move and win you. Hence you go off far from

O Panis, O clouds, go far away to the best place

Vishvedevah Devata, Brahmajaya Juhu or Brahmaputra
Urdhvanabha Rshi






In the beginning, to express and reveal the
joyous manifestation of the creativity of Supreme
Brahma, those first borns of the dynamics of divine law,
Akupara, the light principle or Aditya Rshi, Salila, the
liquid principle or Angira Rshi, Matarishva, the wind
energy principle or Vayu Rshi, Viduhara, the fiery




burning and creative, illustrious, soothing, flowing,
divine souls and spirits express and reveal the divine
voice of the Veda. (This voice is the Ila.)






Soma, the ruling spirit of life, all at peace, having
first received the divine Word, the Vedic voice,
concomitant of omniscience, gives it again to Brahma
in the dynamic Sarasvati form. Varuna, Mitra and Agni
follow, and the yajaka Agni holds it by hand as in the
yajnic ladle and leads it on.






The received form of this divine Vak is to be
practically received by hard discipline. “This is the child
of heaven,” this having been said, “This is not for
communication without practice,” this is the important
injunction. It does not wait for any one, it does not stand
still, it moves on. Its meaning is hidden like the state of
the dominion of a ruler.

4. Deva etasyamavadanta purve saptarsayastapase


The divinities of eternal time and seven ancient
sages who sit down for tapas and cosmic yajna speak
and communicate this. It is the mighty companion of
the devotee of Brahman received through discipline of
celibacy and initiation. Brhaspati, lord of Infinity holds
this sublime Vak in infinite space and time.






The Brahmachari, dedicated to this sublime
subject, goes on pursuing the discpline of the divine
voice and, internalising it, becomes one of, and with,
the nature and presence of the Devas. And thereby, O
sages, the scholar obtains the Word and the wedded wife
escorted to him by the blissful somaic preceptor like
the ghrta ladle for yajnic offering and achievement.




6. Punarvai deva adaduh punarmanusya uta. Raja-




Noble teachers and scholars continuously go on
teaching the Vedic voice and noble people conduct the
yajnic programmes of education. Rulers and brilliant
men of knowledge and generous disposition serving the
divine truth carry on the propagation of the holy Word
and its extension in practice and application.






Thus do sages, scholars and noble people,
serving and spreading the light of divine knowledge
and the Vedic Word, sanctified and energised for life’s
purity, excellence and joy by Devas, serve Brahma, Lord
Supreme in order that they may enjoy and extend the
wealth and creativity of mother earth and the

into the flames of yajnic fire with complete faith and
dedication.


Mandala 10/Sukta 111
Indra Devata, Ashtadanshtra Vairupa Rshi






O men of thought and wisdom, judgement and
reflection, bear your thoughts and offer your songs and
prayers to Indra according to whatever are the thoughts
and faith of the people. With our sincere thoughts, words
and actions, we praise and pray to Indra. He alone is




the lord omnipotent and generous, he alone knows all
that is, and he knows and accepts the thoughtful




2. Rtasya hi sadaso dhitiradyaut sam gastaiyo

Indra is the splendour and sustainer of the
regions of light and vapours of skies, he rises and shines,
playful like the youthful calf of a heifer or Prakrti at the
dawn and comes up in glory with attendant radiations.
He rises with the blaze of light and proclamation of its
might pervading wide and bold the great expansive
regions of space.






Indra knows the course of existence in entirety
as 1s known by revelation of the Veda. He alone is the
ultimate victorious over all, he alone sets the orbit for
the sun, he alone reveals the sacred Word of divine
knowledge. He alone is the master of heaven and earth,

ata us


4. Indro mahna mahato arnavasya vratamina-


Indra is lord almighty by his own omnipotence,
ruling the spatial ocean of particles of matter and energy,
both manifesting and withdrawing them, homage being
done by vibrant sages and blazing stars of the universe.
He creates and extends the many many worlds of space
and he wields the law and the power that holds the entire
worlds of existence.






Indra is the maker and measure of heaven and
earth, knows all operations of the world in existence,
and destroys drought and adversity by showers of rain
and divine grace. He enlightens the great heavens by
the sun and he himself is the pillar of the universe
holding it in dynamic balance by the law of divine Rtam
working in nature.






6. Vajrena hi vrtraha vrtramastaradevasya susuva-


O lord of glory, destroyer of darkness, negativity
and want, destroy the demon of evil by the Bajra,
unfailing catalytic power of nature you wield. O lord
indomitable, be the mighty hero of arms of adamant
and steel, destroy the violent forces of terror, frustrate
the wiles and designs of the uncreative forces of society
and be the saviour by unassailable power of Divinity.






When the lights of the dawn join the sun, then
its rays assume wonderful beauty and glory. Then (in
the day) I see no (other) star of heaven nor any joining
the rising dawn again. Why? What is this mystery? Who
knows of this? (Only Indra).


8. Duram kila prathama jagmurasamindrasya yah


At the rise of the sun, the first rays and the first
mists of the morning move and go far far away. Who


MANDAL - 10/SUKTA - 111 995


knows what and where is their beginning, what is their
basic foundation, what is their middle, and what and
where their end? Who among you knows this mystery?






Indra, when you release the showers of rain
engulfed by the cloud, then these flow down free and
rapidly. Thus those who want freedom and release from
bondage are released by Indra, and once released, they
do not stop on way involved in the bonds (they have




10. Sadhricth sindhumuSsatirivayantsanajjara aritah


Together the streams released by Indra flow and
join the sea like loving women joining their husband,
the lord of time and breaker of the existential bonds

O Indra, may all our earthly wealth and excellences of
sense and mind, all your gifts here, and all our songs of
adoration and voices of prayer ultimately reach you,
the destination from existence to the essence.

Indra Devata, Nabha Prabhedana Vairupa Rshi






Indra, lord of glory, drink of the soma of love
and adoration prepared and offered you as you please
in response to our desire. This morning prayer, adoration
and yajnic homage is primarily and exclusively for you.
Pray be exalted and rise to destroy the enemies and
negativities of life. With our songs and praise we
celebrate your acts of omnipotence and generosity.






Indra, come by that chariot of yours which is
faster than the mind, come to taste the sweets of our
soma of adoration and prayer. May the horses of your
chariot instantly turn and speed hither, mighty horses
by which, all happy and blissful, you come and bless
the devotees.




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 112 997




Let our body, mind and soul be touched by
golden glory of the sun and transmuted into the highest
forms of beauties and graces of life. Indra, thus invoked
and adored by us who yearn for company and
communion with you, pray come, be seated in the heart
and soul in union, joyous and exalted, and lead us to
the divine goal.




4. Yasya tyat te mahimanam madesvime mahi rodast


Indra, whose grandeur in the state of divine
ecstasy even the great heaven and earth do not
comprehend, exalted in that very halo and glory of
ecstasy, come by the dear golden radiations of divinity
harnessed to your chariot and well enjoy the
presentations of our homage, the food cherished by





Indra, that soma which you always enjoy, and




that yajamana whom you always protect and destroy
his enemies with inimitable and incomparable weapons,
that soma is distilled and ready for your drink and, and
that yajamana solicits your radiant attention and
generous favour of grace.




6. Idam te patram sanavittamindra piba somamena


Indra, lord of infinite action, this heart and soul
is ever dedicated to you, pray accept and enjoy the love
and homage presented by the celebrant. Over flowing
is the heart and soul with ecstatic joy and honey sweets
of devotion which all divinities of heaven and earth love
and cherish.




7. Vi hi tvamindra purudha janaso hitaprayaso


Many many people with various kinds of
homage and prayer invoke you, lord of infinite power
and generosity. All these our presents of love, honour

Indra, I celebrate and glorify your eternal
manifestations of might and the highest exploits you
have ever before accomplished. Lord of essential power
and passion, you break the cloud, open the mountains,
and you break the deep silence of the night of
annihilation and proclaim the Word for the men of vision
and wisdom.






O lord of the people, stay and abide with the
people, they celebrate you as the highest incomparable
of the poets of the world of existence. Nothing happens,
nothing is done without you far or near. O lord of glory,
I offer you the highest and most wonderful tribute and
homage and adoration.



10. Abhikhya no maghavan nadhamanantsakhe bodhi




Pray turn to us, watch us with favour, lord of




glory, we beseech you. O lord of world’s wealth, honour
and excellence, O friend, know, acknowledge and accept

battle, commander of imperishable power and force, lead
us on to achieve and share the wealth and honour so far
unshared and unknown.


Mandala 10/Sukta 113
Indra Devata, Shataprabhedana Vairupa Rshi




1. Tamasya dyavaprthivi sacetasa visvebhirde-


May heaven and earth along with all the
nobilities of nature and humanity, all of equal and
agreeable mind, follow, protect and promote the might
of Indra, this ruling power of the world, when he goes
forward to display that power and grandeur of his mind
and senses and, exalted by the happy and exhilarating
glory of his dominion in action, rises in greatness and


2. Tamasya visnurmahimanamojasam’sum dadha-


Vishnu, pervasive power and presence of nature

and humanity, holding, sharing and sustaining its own
part of the power and Dharma of Indra’s dominion by
virtue of its own might and lustre, exlalts the sweetness
and grace of his system, and Indra, ruler of the glorious
dominion, destroying the evil factors of darkness, want
and ignorance with the assistance of his supporters and
divine partners rises mightier, proves his greatness and
majesty and becomes the object of his devotees’ choice
all the more.






When against forces of darkness and serpentine
crookedness you bear weapons and stand firm to fight,
win all agreement, approval and admiration that all is
well, then, O blazing lord of might and glory, all the
Maruts, vibrant powers of nature and humanity in the
world, together with their heart and soul join and exalt
your greatness and the magnanimity of your majesty of
mind and soul.




4. Jajnana eva vyabadhata sprdhah prapasyadviro




From the very rise and manifestation, repelling,
expelling and removing conflicts and confrontations of
jealous forces, watching, assessing and affirming his
fighting forces, breaking down clouds of pent up waters
and mountainous hoards of resources and releasing all
stagnant potentials, and sustaining the mighty vast world
of light and joy by his will, wisdom and active power,
Indra rules and reigns in glory.






Indra keeps, rules and controls all the dynamic
forces of the world together in order, separates, holds,
energises and moves heaven and earth and maintains
the order of separate identity and togetherness in
balance, and, undaunted and invincible, he wields the
thunderbolt of justice and punishment as well as the
golden sceptre of peace and law for people of love,
justice, free choice and generosity.



6. Indrasyatra tavistbhyo virapSina rghayato aram-


When the blazing Indra with his might breaks
the demonic cloud hoarding the waters of life covered


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 113 1003


in darkness, then in honour of the brave hero of
shattering thunder and his brilliant forces, poets sing
songs of adoration.




7. Ya viryani prathamani kartva mahitvebhiryata-


When two warriors, Indra and Vrtra, meet in
battle doing mighty acts of the first order of valour with
their respective valour and power, then, when the
covering darkness is destroyed, Indra with his might
rules the scene and dominates over the first invocation
and institution of yajna.




8. Visve devaso adha vrsnyani te’vardhayantsoma-


And then all saints and holy men of the world
celebrate and exalt your mighty deeds with voices full
of sweetness, love and adoration. And when Vrtra is
destroyed by the fatal blow of Indra and darkness is
dispelled, Indra like the sun waxes in glory as fire rises
in flames, having consumed fuel food with its jaws and

O celebrants of Indra dedicated to yajnic union
and cooperation, celebrate your kinship with Indra
enthusiastically and proclaim with words of power,
praise, love and friendship: Indra listens with faith,
understanding and sympathy at heart to invocation and
prayer for relief of the oppressed and subdues the
vociferous ogres and terrorising destroyers of life and
values of good living. (Such a person is worthy of being
the ruler, Indra of the human nation.)




10. Tvam purunya bhara svasvya yebhirmamsai


Indra, omnipotent ruler of the world, bear and
bring us abundant wealth, honour and excellence
flowing in from all sides so that I may be able to think
and meditate with words of prayer, praise and
and undesirables of the world by simple, natural and
navigable paths of progress, and you now, today itself,


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 114 1005


firmly seat and settle yourself over the wide world and
receive our homage and admiration as tribute of love at
heart in faith.


Mandala 10/Sukta 114


Vishvedevah Devatah, Sadhri Vairupa or Gharma
Tapasa Rshi




1. Gharma samanta trivrtam vyapatustayornustim


Bright heat and light in conjunction pervade the
threefold universe of heaven, earth and the middle
regions. Matarishva, basic cosmic energy and pranic
vitality, joins these two in friendly alliance for love and
service. From the heaven of light and divine awareness
flow vibrations bearing the milk of life and the divine
message of knowledge for human awareness, and divine
souls receive the light of eternal illumination, the Vedic
message with the music of Samans in ecstasy.





Sages who have heard the divine message for




long through discipline carry it on to pass it on to others.
They know, closely watch, internalise and worship the
trinity of eternal reality and its existential dynamics:
Brahma, Prakrti, and Jiva, three modes of Prakrti: sattva,
rajas and tamas, three phases of temporal existence:
creation, continuance and completion, three aspects of
the good life: knowledge, karma and worship, three
aspects of worship: adoration, prayer and meditation in
the triple world of earth, skies and heaven. Poetic vision
arises and creative souls know the original cause of all
these orders of existence and knowledge which operate
in all other open and covert, lowest and highest facts,
activities and disciplines of life. That cause is One,






Fourfold is that reality of existence, knowledge
and the language of knowledge: Prakrti, jiva, immanent
ordainer and the transcendent; matter, energy,
intelligence and avyakta Prakrti; Rks, Samans, Yajus
and Chhandas; Para, pashyanti, madhyama and vaikhari,
in other words, nama, akhyata, upasarga and nipata. The
vedi of existence in which it abides is ever young,
beyond age and death, eternal. It is beautiful and
exciting, golden gracious, which covers all the rules
and laws of existence. In that abide two generous,
creative beautiful birds on the tree of life: the one that


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 114 1007


watches is the Supreme Spirit of the cosmos, and the
other that eats the fruit and tastes the sweet and the bitter
of it is the individual human soul. In that existence, that
knowledge and that Word of knowledge, noble souls
find, live and experience their share of existence and
the divine essence.




4. Ekah suparnah sa samudrama vivesa sa idam


One and One only is the cosmic spirit which
pervades and manifests in the boundless ocean of space-
and-time. It watches, illuminates and inspires this entire
universe. I see it with pure and transparent mind
manifesting at the closest. Prakrti which is the mother
medium of its manifestation embraces it in love, and it
too loves and embraces the mother medium. So also,
divine Speech which is the mother medium of its
expression embraces it in love, and it too loves and
embraces the mother medium.






Vibrant self-realised sages and visionary poets
visualise and express the One immutable Spirit by words




of their experiential vision. Taking on to the poetic
compositions of Vedic mantras in yajnas and meditative
sessions they visualise and restructure twelve cyclic
manifestations and self-expressions of soma, the moon,
the sun and the light beyond the sun and moon, and the
spirit of life itself.




6. Sattrisamsca caturah kalpayantaschandamsi ca


Visualising and re-structuring the modes and
manifestations of the Soma spirit through thirty-six and
four poetic structures bearing upto the twelfth of the
forms, having enacted the yajna with their thought and
imagination, the sages accomplish the yajnic cycle with
Rks and Samans.






Fourteen are other majestic manifestations of
this soma spirit of the universe in dynamic yajnic form
which seven grand sages conduct with the voice divine.
And here, in this world of limited human imagination,
who can explain and reveal in human terms that all-
pervasive saviour spirit in its reality and that central


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 114 1009


path by which the sages move up to divinity and have a
drink of the soma ecstasy of divinity distilled through
experience?




8. Sahasradha pancadasanyuktha yavad dyavapr-


Thousandfold are the Vedic hymns, fifteen of
them the highest and best, all extended as far as the
heaven and earth. Thousandfold are the majesties and
glories of it, the Vedic Word and vision extending and
abiding as far as the vision and omniscience of divinity.






Who is the constant sage that knows the
structure, end and purpose of the hymns? Who attains
to the centre meaning of divine reality corresponding
to the word of divine voice? Who would say who is the
eighth veteran of the sagely yajakas? Who knows the
two mighty carriers of the cosmic chariot of Indra?








Some of the horses of Indra, master of the solar
chariot, as rays of the sun, reach the ends of the solar
regions while they abide yoked to the poles of the
chariot. The divinities of nature provide them with food
to replenish the energy spent, when the sun rests inside


Mandala 10/Sukta 115
Agni Devata, Upastuta Varshtihavya Rshi




1. Citra icchisostarunasya vaksatho na yo matara-


Wondrous is the invigorating and sustaining
power of the newly risen youthful Agni which never
goes to its parental source for food and energy
replenishment. And if you say that the udderless creator
ambassadorial mission, it carries the fragrant message
of yajna to the divinities immediately on its birth.




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 115 1011


2. Agnirha nama dhayi dannapastamah sam yo vana


Agni, ‘high priest’ is the name given to ‘fire’,
fiery leader of yajna, which, heroic of action, giving
generously, takes to the woods with blazing flames and
crackling jaws and, noble deity of yajna as it is, with
ladlefuls of havi joins us with gifts of life like a mighty
roaring cloud raining on pastures and fields of corn.






O celebrants of yajna, celebrate Agni, the leader,
watching every thing like a bird on the tree, abiding in
every thing dynamic, brilliant and generous, profuse
giver of food and joy, thundering as a cloud of living
showers and deep as the sea, consumer of havi by flames
of fire and giver of light by sun rays, mighty strong and
exalted, grand achiever of victories and pioneer path
maker and illuminator like the sun.



4. Vi yasya te jrayasanasyajara dhaksorna vatah




Agni, power unaging and dynamic, inviolable
and imperishable are your forces like the radiations of
dazzling light and blazing fire which, like victorious
warriors, come to you, power indomitable and presence
pervasive in three worlds, and exhort you for their life’s




19. Sa idagnih kanvatamah kanvasakharyah para-


That Agni, lord and leader of life, wisest pioneer
and comrade of the warring wise, is the saviour giver
of success and fulfilment to devotees far and near across
difficulties within and outside. May Agni protect and
promote the celebrants and the brave and give us the
advantage of their protection and advancement.




6. Vajintamaya sahyase supitrya trsu cyavano anu


and earth, I, spontaneously inspired and exalted, offer
homage and pray for protection to the most powerful
pervasive and aware, ever true, highest and most


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 115 1013


glorious protector and promoter who provides succour
and sustenance of high order even in dry desert lands
of no water by his indomitable power and potential.




7. Evagnirmartaih saha suribhirvasuh stave saha-


Thus Agni, wealth, power and shelter of the
world, inspirer of strength, ambition and enthusiasm
for life, is adored and exalted by the brave along with
the leading lights of vision and action, though mortals
all, who, constantly disciplined in mind, dedicated to
truth and yajnic action for creativity and production of
good things for life, like friends of mankind in unison
and united action, excel and lead ordinary humanity by
virtue of their brilliance and shining achievements.




8. Urjo napat sahasavanniti vopastutasya vandate


“Child of energy, creator, sustainer and master
of strength, energy and victory, undaunted and
inviolable wielder of courage, patience and enthusiasm
for living”, thus does the celebrant’s profound vision
and word describe you as he closely watches and adores
you. We, holy, brave and grateful, praise you while we




enjoy your gift of good health, long life and the vision
and hope of ultimate success and fulfilment.






Agni, lord omniscient, leading light of existence,
cosmic energy of nature, thus do visionary sages, close
watchful scholars, children of yajakas pursuing,
enacting and accomplishing yajnic acts for rain showers
and gifts of generous nature, describe and adore you.
Pray protect and promote them with success. Bless the
celebrants. Advance the veteran scholars. “Here is the
havi, pray accept the oblation”, saying this they raise
the hand for offering and rise. “Salutations to Agni and
honour to the generous giver for the achievement of
showers, food and energy,” saying this with surrender
and submission they rise and achieve their mission’s
success and fulfilment.

4. A dvibarha amino yatvindro vrsa haribhyam


May generous Indra, mighty ruler of the powers

of centrifugal and centripetal forces of nature and society

forces of resistance to cooperate with your blazing fight
against the anti-life elements. Face the enemies and
uproot them in our battle for health and the good life.




6. Vyarya indra tanuhi Sravamsyojah sthireva


Indra, lord of life and human society, expand
the resources of food, energy and sustenance, heighten
the power and prestige of life and extend the spatial
knowledge and power as on a permanent basis.
Unresisted and inviolable by virtue of your own
patience, persistence and power, rising in strength and
lustre of glory before us, raise the power and prestige
of the self and the total human organisation.






Indra, lord of glory, this homage and tribute is
offered to you. O ruler of self, humanity and all life,

8. Addhidindra prasthitema havimsi cano dadhisva


Indra, ruling lord of nature and human society,

natural and human system of evolution and progress.
Take the food prepared and the soma distilled as our

Bearing food and tribute of homage we love and honour

I send up this song of adoration to Indra, lord of

Mandala 10/Sukta 117
Dana-stuti or Indra Devata, Bhikshu Angirasa Rshi






The devas have ordained death for mortals, but
not for reasons of hunger alone, because death overtakes
the rich and well provided too. The wealth of the
generous giver of charity does not diminish while the
uncharitable finds no grace, none to comfort him.




2. Ya adhraya cakamanaya pitvo’nnavantsan


The man of means in plenty who does not give
in charity to the poor, needy, hunger afflicted supplicant
that comes to his door but hardens his heart and, further,
himself enjoys the fruits of his riches in his very
presence, finds no grace, no comfort, none to console
him.








Bounteous blest is he who gives to the needy
seeker desirous of food and to the wanderer in search,
gone feeble. Amplitude comes to him at his call for his
purpose, and he creates friendly alliances even among
those who once opposed him.




4. Na sa sakha yo na dadati sakhye sacabhuve


No friend is he who gives no help and
sustenance to the friend, the assistant and the associate.
Denied, the friend goes away from him. No home is
this house of the miser mean, if the friend in need has
to knock at another door, the house of a generous helpful




5. Prniyadinnadhamanaya tavyan draghiyam-


The rich man should give for the poor seeker,
he should see the paths of life in the long run. Riches
move like wheels of the chariot: Now they are at one
place, now they move to another.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 117 1021






The man of no knowledge and short vision gets
food in vain and prosperity for nothing. Verity I say
that prosperity is his ruin, his very death in life. He
prospers not who helps neither the friend nor the wise,
eating all by himself he eats nothing but sin.






The ploughman ploughing the land produces
food for the hungry, the traveller while moving crosses
the path to destination, the vocal sage is better than the
silent, and the giving friend and brother is better than
the non-giving.

8. Ekapadbhiuyo dvipado vi cakrame dvipat tripa-




In the process of evolution and mutual
exhortation, the man of the first order of wealth looks




up to the man of double order of wealth and, if he be
active and generous, may even surpass the doubly rich
person. Similarly, the man of double order of wealth
looks up to the man of triple wealth and may even
surpass him. Later, the man of triple wealth looks up to
the man of fourfold wealth and may overtake and even
surpass him. Thus in evolution, competition,
cooperation and mutual exhortation, the generous man
of initiative goes on and on, watching and abiding in
the line of the progressive evolution of humanity.



9. Samau ciddhastau na samam vivistah sammatara




The two hands, howsoever alike, do not perform
equally well, two mother cows, alike and equal
otherwise, do not yield the same quality and quantity of

equal and the same, and two persons may be closely
related, still they are not equal and exactly alike in

You rise in flames of glory and respond with
fragrant joy to the oblations of ghrta when ladlefuls are
brought close to the vedi and poured into the fire.


Venerable Agni, when it is invoked and adored
with Vedic mantras, rises and shines when it is served


and exalted with ladlefuls of ghrta as the prime power
of yajna.




4. Ghrtenagnih samajyate madhupratika ahutah.


Agni, honoured and adored with ghrta, served
and adorned with honey sweets, invoked and exalted
with Vedic hymns, shines and illuminates us as the sun.







Invoked, celebrated and exalted, you rise and
shine, harbinger of fragrances for the divinities of nature
and noble humanity, and as such the mortals invoke and
adore you in their yajnic celebrations.



6. Tam marta amartyam ghrtenagnim saparyata.

That immortal Agni, the mortals serve with


ghrta, Agni that is the redoubtable master protector of
the home and family.





Agni, with your inviolable and irresistible light

shine and blaze as protector and promoter of the yajna

2. Pra vata iva dodhata unma pita ayamsata.




Like impetuous winds have the exhilarations of

The draughts of divine soma have raised me up

Nor can all the five communities elude or blur

Mandala 10/Sukta 120
Indra Devata, Brhaddiva Atharvana Rshi




1. Tadidasa bhuvanesu jyestham yato jajna ugra-


That Indra, Brahma, is the first and highest
among all the worlds in existence, of which, as the
original cause, is born the blazing, refulgent potent sun
which, always rising every moment, destroys the
negativities which damage life and by which all positive
and protective powers and people of the world rejoice
and celebrate life.



2. Vavrdhanah savasa bhuryojah satrurdasaya


Growing mighty in strength, immensely
lustrous, destroyer of negativities, it strikes fear into




the heart of forces causing damage to life and the
environment. Bountiful purifier and sustainer of the
breathing and non-breathing world, all the people and
powers which receive sustenance from you join to do
honour to you in their joy and celebration of life.






And they all, celebrants of divinity, surrender
all actions and prayers to you when they join in couples
and grow to three in the family. O lord sweeter than
sweetness itself, join the sweets of life with honey and
with divine sweetness and bliss create life overflowing
with love and ecstasy.




4. Iti ciddhi tva dhana jayantam mademade


Thus with joy on every happy occasion of life,
grateful people and vibrant sages celebrate you, winner,
creator and giver of wealth and excellence. Illustrious
lord of shattering power, expand the commonwealth of
permanent values. Let not the crooked and fiendish
forces on the prowl suppress the creative gifts of divine


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 120 1031





With your divine inspiration, well knowing the
weapons of war, we fight out the enemies of life in the
battles of humanity. I strengthen and calibrate the arms
and ammunitions for battle by your divine words, and
by the same divine formula I sharpen the target efficacy
of the arrows and missiles of defence and offence.




6. Stuseyyam puruvarpasamrbhvaminatamama-

We love and celebrate Indra in song, lord
adorable infinite in form, all pervasive, most glorious
and wisest of the self-realised wise. With his might he
breaks seven types of clouds and seven orders of sin
and evil, and he challenges and subdues the many
adversaries that arise in the world of nature and







You sustain this visible world of physical reality
and the other invisible world of meta-physical and
spiritual reality in which you maintain and protect
everything with your might in their very home. And
you hold and stabilise the revolving motherly earth and
heaven, inspire many great actions therein and see them




8. Ima brahma brhaddivo vivaktindraya susama-


The poet of boundless heavenly light speaks
these divine verses in honour of Indra for his own
spiritual peace and pleasure. First and foremost among
eminent poets, self-illuminant, self-refulgent and self-
controlled, he masters the mighty treasure of Vedic
wisdom and he opens the flood gates of his own vision
of universal light and wisdom.






Thus does the sage of boundless light and vision
of wisdom with settled mind address his song of
adoration to Indra only, and the pure immaculate fluent
streams of speech like motherly creations inspire the


MANDAL - 10/SUKTA - 121 1033


world and exalt humanity with strength and enthusiasm.


Mandala 10/Sukta 121
Kah (Prajapati) Devata, Hiranyagarbha Prajapatya Rshi




1. Hiranyagarbhah samavartatagre bhitasya jatah


Hiranyagarbha, the golden Seed, one lord of
light and the sole creator of lights such as the sun, existed
before creation (as he ever exists). He alone was and is
the lord and sustainer of all forms of created being. He
holds and sustains the earth and heaven and supports
this whole universe. We worship the same one lord and
offer him homage with oblations of fragrant materials.






The lord who is the giver of birth to the soul
with its power and potential in body, whose glory all
the divinities of the world celebrate in song, whose shade
of protection is immortality and falling off is death, to
him we offer our homage and worship in hymns with
havi.








The sole one lord who, with his own might,
creates and rules over the world of those who breathe
and see, the lord who rules over both men and animals,
to that sovereign lord of bliss and majesty we offer
homage and worship with our heart and soul.




4. Yasyeme himavanto mahitva yasya samudram


proclaim, whose depth and grandeur the ocean with
rivers declares, whose arms these quarters of space
extend to infinity, that lord of light and sublimity let us
worship with offers of homage in havis.






By him the suns blaze, by him the earth is firm,
by him the heaven of bliss is sustained, by him the
ecstasy of Moksha is constant, and he is the creator of
the worlds of space. Let us worship the lord refulgent
and omnipotent with offers of homage in havis.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 121 1035




6. Yam krandasi avasa tastabhane abhyaiksetam


Whom eloquent heaven and earth sustained in
balance by divine power, shining in splendour and
inspired at heart, manifest in glory and celebrate in song,
under whose law the sun rises, shines and illuminates
the world, that self-refulgent lord let us worship with
offers of havis.






When the boundless ocean of charged particles
of Vayu energy comes into existence bearing the implicit
blue print of the cosmos in seed form, creating the heat
mode of existence, then the one supreme of the
divinities, living breathing life itself, emerges in advance
of all cosmic forms, and that One all-comprehensive
divine lord let us worship with oblations of havi, who
else? That is Hiranyagarbha.



8. Yascidapo mahina paryapasyad daksam dadhana




The one who with his might pervades, watches
and overall controls the ocean of charged particles of
Vayu energy bearing the heat mode producing the yajnic
process of life’s evolution, who is on top of all the
divinities of existence, that One supreme lord let us
worship with havis.




9. Ma no himsijanita yah prthivya yo va divam


May the one lord supreme never hurt us, the
lord that is creator of the earth, who also creates the
heavens and who also creates the vast oceans of energies
and waters, all beauteous, soothing and blissful, the
master, controller and ordainer of all the laws of
existence in operation in truth. Let us worship that one
lord supreme with offers of faith and havis.




10. Prajapate na tvadetanyanyo visva jatani pari ta


Prajapati, lord of life and your children, there is
none other than you who rules over life forms and
materials in existence, for yours are the laws of


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 122 1037


you wish we should desire, all that we pray for, may all
that be fulfilled in life for us. May we be masters in
control of the wealths, honours and excellences of the
world within your laws of life.


Mandala 10/Sukta 122
Agni Devata, Chitramaha Vasishtha Rshi






wondrous generous and refulgent, lovely, comfortable,
welcome as a noble guest, all love free from jealousy.
Master protector of the home, yajamana as well as high
priest of life’s yajna, he blesses us with all protective,
universally nourishing and positive heroic powers and
creative energies of life.




2. Jusano agne prati harya me vaco visvani vidvan


Loving and adorable Agni, universal knower of
the laws and ways of life, presiding power of all holy
works, pray listen to my words and accept my prayer :
Rising and refulgent with ghrta, inspire the sage and




open up the paths of progress for him. Divinities and
noble souls raising you in yajna adore you, join you
and raise themselves in pursuance of your laws of life.






Immortal Agni, pervading seven regions of the
universe, bhu, bhuva, sva, maha, jana, tapa and satyam,
advance and exalt the noble and generous yajamana of
holy action. Whoever brings and offers holy fuel and
fragrant havi to you, pray accept and bless him with
noble progeny and abundant wealth of life.




4. Yajnasya ketum prathamam purohitam havisma-


Seven priests with seven pranas and seven
faculties of sense and mind offer havi and adore Agni,
first and original performer of creation yajna who bears
on the banner of creative yajna to its victorious
completion, and they go on serving the seven-rayed light
of life, listening, fed on and rising by ghrta, generous
lord refulgent who blesses the dedicated celebrant with
noble strength and happy progeny.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 122 1039




oF Tvam dutah prathamo varenyah sa huyamano


Agni, you are the messenger and harbinger of
the breeze of fresh life. You are the first divinity of our
love and choice. As such, invoked and adored for the
sake of immortality, pray rejoice at yajna and let us
rejoice too. Vibrant celebrants and veteran sages, shining
and raising you in the house of generous yajamana,
honour and exalt you with holy songs of adoration.




6. Isam duhantsudugham visvadhayasam yajnapriye


Agni, light and presiding power of yajnic action,
bringing plenty of food, energy, prosperity and the milk
of human generosity by the mother spirit of the universe
for the noble yajamana dedicated to yajna in love and
faith, rising in flames of glory by oblations of ghrta,
pervading the three dynamic regions of heaven, earth
and the skies with light and splendour, and suffusing
the yajnic home in life’s fragrance, you carry on the
divine purpose in the world of nature and humanity.






in Tvamidasya usaso vyustisu dutam krnvana


Agni, light of life, in the rising lights of this
morning’s dawn, thoughtful people adore you in yajna
as the harbinger of nature’s bounties and carrier of their
love and faith with fragrance to the divinities. Nobilities
adore you and divinities exalt you, great as you are, and
pray for their own rise in merit while they suffuse you
in ghrta in the yajna vedi.




8. Ni tva vasistha ahvanta vajinam grnanto agne


Agni, men of light and vision established in
divine consciousness invoke and adore you, light and
spirit of cosmic power, and they celebrate your divine
supremacy over nature and humanity. O victorious lord
of universal knowledge, power and prosperity, pray bear
and bring us the wealth of life’s health and excellence
for the yajamanas. O sages and scholars of divinity and
science of yajna, pray protect and promote us always
with all round well being of life on earth.


Mandala 10/Sukta 123
Vena Devata, Vena Bhargava Rshi




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 123 1041



This loving and lovely light, glorious sun, womb
of light, shines in varied light and beauty in the ocean
of particles of mist in middle space, moves and energises
the clouds of vapour, and in the meeting of the sun rays
and the vapours sages celebrate and adore the sun with
songs of prayer and love with gratitude as a child of



2. Samudradurmimudiyarti veno nabhojah prstham


Rising from the skies, the sun radiates its waves
of light, draws waves of mist from the ocean, energises
clouds of mist from the ocean of space, the vault of
glorious heaven across the skies is seen, the glory shines
on top of the high heaven of nature’s yajna, and the
sages celebrate both dawn and the vault of heaven







Equal and abundant, shining and thundering




currents of natural energy, mother generators of clouds
of rain, abiding together with vapours and sun rays in
the skies, also active on top of nature’s dynamics, inspire
the honey sweets of sage’s immortal songs of divine




4. Jananto rupamakrpanta vipra mrgasya ghosam


The sages, knowing the form, structure and
functioning of the cloud and the roaring thunder,
celebrate it and realise it in practice. Going by laws of
natural truth, waters, evaporation and cloud formation
and catalysis in the depth of spatial ocean, they realise
that it is really the sun which holds the earth and controls
the immortal waters for sure.




5. Apsara jaramupasismiyana yosa bibharti parame


Like a youthful belle holding on to her lover,
the lightning with a brilliant smile holds on to and
sustains with the cloud in the highest skies, and the cloud
too, dear and lovely, moving about in the spatial home
of his lovely light and lightning, stays by the side of the


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 123 1043






6. Nake suparnamupa yat panantam hrda venanto


O Sun, wrapped in wondrous rays flying around
in the highest heaven, loving sages with their heart and
soul see and realise you at the closest as a messenger of
the supreme lord of love and justice and as a mighty
bird blazing and flying with golden wings in the vast
space of the lord ordainer of the universe.






High up over there abides the sun in the region
of heavenly light. It bears wondrous weapons of divinity
such as thunder and lightning. It wears a beautiful,
fragrant form soothing for people to see, and like the
light and bliss of heaven creates divine waters and many
other dear divine gifts for life.






8. Drapsah samudramabhi yajjigati pasyan


When the sun in the third, highest, heaven,
shining on the oceans and vapours in the skies with the
light of its fervent rays reaches the clouds of vapour,
then the blazing heat with pure and powerful energy
catalyses the clouds and condenses the vapours into dear
valuable drops that shower in rain upon the earth.


Mandala 10/Sukta 124
Devata: Agni (1), Agni’s Atma (2-4), Varuna (5, 7-8),






Agni, yajnic light of life, come to this life yajna
of ours: which has five divisions, i1.e., Brahma-yajna,
Deva-yajna, Pitr-yajna, Atithi-yajna, and Balivaishva-
deva-yajna; conducted by five people, 1.6, four socio-
economic classes of Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas
and Shudras and others like chance visitors from other
groups there might be; which is threefold, i.e., paka
yajna, haviryajna and somayajna; and which has seven
Shodashi, Vajapeya, Atiratra and Aptoyami. You are our
leader and pioneer, Agni, and you are the carrier of our
yajna to the divinities as well as harbinger of the fruits


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 124 1045


of yajna to us. Pray come and be our all time dispeller
of the cavern of deep darkness from life.


(Yajna is a creative process of development
in life from the individual to the social, national, global
and environmental level of life. The explanation above
is related to the social level. Swami Brahmamuni
explains the yajna at the individual level, and that is
also suggested in Rgveda 10, 7, 6: “Svayam yajasva’,
and yajurveda 4, 13: “Iyam te yajniya tanu”, which
means: Develop yourself by yajna according to the
seasons of your growth, and remember your life in body,
mind and soul is worthy of yajnic service for your
personal development, your body being the first
instrument of your wider yajna of life. This personal
yajna is fivefold, for the elemental balance of earth,
water, heat, air and ether; threefold for the balance of
vata, pitta and kaf, and also for balanced growth of body,
mind and soul; sevenfold for the growth of rasa, rakta,
mansa, meda, asthi, majja and virya. Thus yajna is the
process of growth beginning with the individual,
accomplished at the cosmic level.)




2. Adevaddevah pracata guha yan prapasyamano


When I, the soul, transcending the mere
physical, non-divine, form, take on to the light of
divinity within the heart cave of the soul, I see the light
of divinity within and attain to it. Thus when I relinquish
my dark side of personality, attaining to the light and




peace of divinity, then by reason of my essential affinity
with divinity, I reach the life divine, sole centre of
existence, just like fire existing at peace in the arani
wood, its natural abode, rising into heat and light at





Watching the traveller of another path of life
other than the physical, the bird on another branch of
the tree, and seeing the original home of the cosmic
yajna, I enact many vedis to follow the yajnic paths of
living. I sing songs of homage in honour of the
omnipotent father giver of life and take to my share of
yajnic living, away from the selfish ways of existence.




4. Bahvih sama akaramantarasminnindram vrnanah


Having lived in this body, vedi of living yajna,
and choosing Indra, omnipotent father, for worship, I
give up the vedi. Agni, vital heat, Varuna, mind and
senses and the water element, and Soma, living vitality,
depart, and moving ahead I come to the freedom of
existence which I cherish and protect for further life.


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 124 1047




oF Nirmaya u tye asura abhuvan tvam ca ma varuna


When I get the freedom of my state of being, let
the demonic forces be void of their powers, and O
Varuna, lord of love, justice and fulfilment, pray bless
me with love and protection. O ruling lord of existence,
eliminating untruth by the rule of truth and divine law,
come and take over the ultimate sovereignty of my free




6. Idam svaridamidasa vamamayam prakasa


O Soma, spirit of life in the state of freedom,
this is the state of bliss, this is beauty, this is the light of
life, this is the expansive space to sojourn at will. Come
up out of all sense of bondage. We two shall eliminate
darkness and nescience. You are the havi and you the
object of love and adoration too. We powers of divine
law and truth of existence serve and bless you, our
darling, with your real self and blessings of total








The sovereign creator with his divine vision and
power created the light and placed it as the sun in
heaven. Varuna, the same lord omnipotent of the element
of waters, created and released the rivers aflow which,
pure and creative mothers, harbingers of peace and joy,
bear and manifest the generosity and majesty of the lord.




8. Ta asya jyesthamindriyam sacante ta ima kseti


Those streams of living waters share and bear
the highest power and beneficence of this lord Varuna,
and the lord rules and abides in these streams which
sparkle and flow, enjoying the fragrance of oblations
offered in yajna. They, also, like people choosing and
abiding by the ruler, free from fear and keeping off from
darkness and evil, flow free from fear and obstruction.


9. Bibhatsunam sayujam hamsamahurapam


The sun, companion of the free and fearless
clouds, which sojourns in space as a comrade of the


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 125 1049


holy waters, the poets call the ‘celestial bird’, and the
wind and electric energy blowing and radiating in
response to yajna with anushtup verses, they know with
their vision and imagination, and this they call ‘Indra’.


Mandala 10/Sukta 125
Atma Devata, Vagambhrni Rshi






I am Vak-ambhrni, voice of omniscience,
Universal Speech all bearing, all borne, co-existent with
eleven Rudras, pranic energies and the soul, eight Vasus,
earth, water, fire, air, space, moon, sun and stars, all
abodes and supports of life, twelve Adityas, year’s
twelve phases of the sun, and all the Vishvedevas,
divinities of nature and humanity. I pervade and support
both Mitra and Varuna, day and night, I pervade and
support Indra and Agni, wind and fire, and I bear and
support both the Ashvins, all complementarities of
nature and humanity such as positive and negative
currents of energy and science and technology.


(Language, Vak or Word, is a system
corresponding to and co-existent with existence as a
system and the awareness or knowledge of existence.
Hence language at the level of divine awareness is co-
existent and co-extensive with existence itself. In other
words, at the level of omniscience, existence is language
and language is existence. In our life, our language is




the seat of correspondence between our awareness and
knowledge of existence and its articulation in
experience, expression and communication.)






I bear the reception and expression of experience
in communication and the soma joy of corporate
existence. I bear the formative evolution, nourishment
and growth, and the power and glory of life and its
progress. I bear the wealth and prosperity of life for the
yajamana who creates beauty and sweetness for life and
bears liberal havis of corporate yajna for the common
welfare of humanity and indeed all life. (In other words,
the content of Language is Existence and the awareness
of Existence.)






I am the spirit and organisation of the social
system. I am the pioneer and harbinger of the wealth,
honours and excellences of the corporate system with
the people. I am the thought, awareness and determined
organisation of the basics of human life and its values.
Sages and scholars establish me in many socio-political


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 125 1051


forms with many permanent stabilities and many
evolving powers and possibilities of progress in various




4. Maya so annamatti yo vipasyati yah praniti ya


O listener, listen, what I say to you is worth
listening and doing in faith: Whoever sees whatever he
hears what is said, he receives the food of life by me.
Those who do not listen, do not care, do not believe
what I say and neglect me, they waste away, they come
to ruin.


(We may realise here that Vagambhrni is not only
the voice of divinity, it is also the voice of the people
who think and speak truly, positively and jointly
whenever and wherever they happen to do so, whether
it be in parliaments or assemblies or in the press or in
the universities. And this voice must be invariably true
and authentic.)






And all this that is loved, adored and spoken by




the sages and veteran scholars and even by average
mortals of honest mind, take it that I, voice of divinity,
speak it myself. Whosoever I love by virtue of his or
her merit of nature, character and performance, I raise
to brilliance, to piety worthy of a yajnic Brahma, to the
vision of a poetic sage and high intelligence of an




6. Aham rudraya dhanuratanimi brahmadvise


I draw the bow for Rudra, powers of justice and
punishment, to eliminate the forces of hate and violence
against lovers and observers of piety and divinity. I fight
for the people and create felicity and joy for them, and
I reach and pervade the heaven and earth.




7. Aham suve pitaramasya murdhan mama yonira-


I create the parental protector on top of this
human nation and this world in the form of the ruler
and the sun. My place is in the depth of waters and the
sea and in the particles of space. That same way I abide
in all worlds of the universe, and I reach that heaven of
light and touch the very top of it with my light and


MANDAL - 10/SUKTA - 126 1053






Loving, embracing and pervading all regions
of the universe, I flow forward like the wind that blows
across the spaces. Beyond the heaven, beyond this world
I am, so much is my power and potential, immanent
and transcendent my presence.

O devas, divinities of nature, noble scholars and

4. Yuyam visvam pari patha varuno mitro aryama.


Mitra, Varuna and Aryama, you protect, guide

We pray, under the loving care, security and felicity of

your law and order, let us advance to our cherished goal,
pursuing noble ethics and policies beyond the wicked.






May the Adityas, brilliant scholars of the Aditya
order of forty eight years discipline, Varuna, Mitra and
Aryama, powers of justice, love and rectitude, protect
us and guide us across violence and enmity and lead us
to success. We invoke the blazing commander with his
of evil and suffering, Indra, mighty ruler, and Agni,
brilliant teacher and scholar, for all round protection
and well being so that we may overcome the forces of
hate, jealousy and enmity and reach our goals.



6. Netara u su nastiro varuno mitro aryama.



May Varuna, Mitra and Aryama, leaders and
brilliant rulers of the people, judicious, loving and nobly
motivated, safely pilot us across all sin and evil of the
world and all forces of hate, jealousy and enmity of








May Varuna, Mitra and Aryama, powers of
justice, and noble choice, love and friendship, and noble
ethics and policy, bring us peace and progress for our
protection and advancement. May the Adityas, brilliant
scholars, teachers and researchers give us lasting
comfort and well being of wide variety which we seek
and pray for, and may all these divine nobilities lead us
beyond the reach of the forces of hate and enmity.




8. Yatha ha tyadvasavo gauryam cit padi sitama-


O Vasus, world powers of peace and settlement,
scholars of the Vasu order, all loving and adorable in
cow at freedom to roam around at peace with joy, so
pray release us from the bonds of sin and evil. O Agni,
lord of light, give us a life of enlightenment, a long life
of good health and light of wisdom.

Look, there comes the night divine with many


many starry eyes, embracing the wide world, wearing
all her finery of the beauty and grandeur of the skies.




2. Orvapra amartya nivato devyudvatah.


The immortal night divine comes filling vast
spaces high and low and arrests the darkness with the
light of her stars.





Coming and advancing, the night divine
prepares the way for its sister dawn which then dispels
the dark.


4. Sano adya yasya vayamni te yamannaviksmahi.
That night divine, on whose arrival we rest in


the home like birds asleep in their nest, may, we pray,
be restful and auspicious for us now.


1058






People come back home and rest in sleep. So
do animals, so do birds, eagles too. They need rest and
sleep after the day’s toil.

6. Yavaya vrkyam vrkam yavaya stenamurmye.
O peaceful night, keep away the wolf and the
wolfish deeds. Keep away the thief. Fold them in sleep.
Be peaceable, soothing and refreshing for us.

Enveloping darkness in all its intensity has come
and smothered me. O dawn, take it off and give me relief
like freedom from a heavy debt.

8. Upa te ga ivakaram krnisva duhitardivah.


O night, daughter of heaven, I present this song


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 128 1059


of adoration like a gift of milch cows. Pray accept it as
homage for the sake of the supplicant who is keen for
victory of rest and light over the wolf and the darkness
of life.


Mandala 10/Sukta 128
Vishvedeva Devata, Vihavya Angirasa Rshi






Agni, light of life, leader and pioneer of men,
let there be vigour and lustre in me in the battles of life.
Let us shine and rise in body, mind and soul while we
kindle you in the yajnic development of human society.
Let the four directions of life and the people there be
favourable to me in love and faith, and let us win the
battles of life under your leadership and presiding power.




2. Mama deva vihave santu sarva indravanto maruto


In the battle of life when the clarion call is given,
let all the Devas, divinities of nature and nobilities of
humanity be for me. Let the Maruts, Vishnu and Agni,
all with Indra, stormy troops, all pervasive people power,




and the leading lights of humanity, all inspired with
passion and energy, all wielding weapons of fire, wind
and electric power, be with me. Let the sky and space
be the vast world for me. And let the winds blow for me
in this beautiful world for the fulfilment of this yajnic
ambition for personal and collective expansion.

brave and great and help us rise to bravery and grandeur.
Never deplete us either by loss of health and virility or

Mandala 10/Sukta 129
Bhavavrttam Devata, Prajapati Parameshthi Rshi




It was neither a-sat nor sat, neither non-existence




particles nor sky nor space nor anything beyond. What
form? What content? None. Where? What purpose, for
whom? What mist? What deep darkness? None, nothing,
and yet not nothing.


(It was the zero state of existence after the
completion of one cycle and before the beginning of
the next cycle, like the zero hour between two dates. It
is a state intangible and inexplicable because thought
and language too terminate into the intangible and
inexplicable silence at the completion of the cycle. The
zero hour exists and yet it does not, it doesn’t exist and
yet it does, that’s the mystery of it. The state under
meditation in this sukta is the hour of Infinity in the
womb of Infinity self-brooding on the zero; the One
upon the zero.)






of immortality, neither night nor day as we know the
night and day. There is only That, the One self-existent
Brahma, breathing without breath, the sole One, one
with its potential. Any other apart or beyond That there
was none whatsoever.




MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 129 1065




There is only dark, darker and deeper than
darkness itself before the world of existence comes into
being, something misty beyond knowledge and
experience, this all that now is. That living mystery,
which then exists, covered in something more
mysterious than mystery itself, self-manifests by the
exercise of Its own grandeur of power and potential
solely by Itself.




4. Kamastadagre samavartatadhi manaso retah


There is love and desire before the creation at
the heart of Brahma which is the first, original and
ultimate seed of the world of existence that comes into
being. Sages blest with vision, by divine inspiration and
mind in meditation, realise the world of existence from
the tangible upto the intangible state implicit in the seed
state of Prakrti subsisting in the divine mind.







The waves and vibrations of these causal
potentials of divine Prakrti extend in time and space all
round, up, down and transverse. There are the individual
souls also, seedlings great and yearning for emergence
into life. In all this process of creation and evolution,
the divine will is supreme, and the divine potential,
Prakrti, the seeding souls, and potential evolutions, are
all subservient and subordinate to the divine will.




6. Ko addha veda ka iha pra vocat kuta ajata kuta


Who for certain knows, who here would declare
whence this universe has come, whence this variety has
emerged? The visionary sages all come after the creation
and diversity of it. Who of them would then know
whence and why all this has come into existence? Only
He, the creator, would know, only He can reveal and
declare.




7. Iyam visrstiryata ababhuva yadi va dadhe yadi
veda yadi va na veda.


O dear seeker, whence this multitudinous variety
of existence arises, who holds and sustains it, or whether
He doesn’t hold and sustain it while He terminates it,


MANDAL - 10 / SUKTA - 130 1067


only He knows who is the presiding power of it at the
highest heavenly level of mystery. Only He knows and
pervades it, and He only knows when he doesn’t pervade
it while it subsists in Him as in the state of Pralaya.

The yajnic cosmos, the web of existence, which
is extended and expands all round by vibrations,
radiations, currents, flames, streams, fibres and filaments
spun out and woven by a hundred plus one divine actions
Vishvedevas, fortynine Maruts and ten Vishvasrj
creative processes) all this web of yajna, these divinities
universally prevailing weave up and down all round,
and all these divinities, actions and processes abide
therein, in the yajna itself.






The supreme cosmic Purusha weaves this web




of existence and the same Purusha winds it up on time.
He alone in this cosmos and beyond the heaven of time
and space extends it. These radiations, vibrations,
threads, filaments and creative processes abide and act
in this vast yajna of the cosmos, and they structure the
holy formulas and they spin the threads of the warp and
woof of this web.





What is the central vision and comprehensive
blueprint of the design of cosmic yajna? What is the
measure of the progressive stages of the yajna upto
accomplishment? What is the basic cause and ultimate
purpose? What is the ghrta input of the yajna? What is
the ultimate bound? What is the chhanda, joyous
formula, from the inception and conception to
completion? What is the beginning, middle and the

Virat is associated with Mitra and Varuna
together, trishtup is associated with Indra as share of
the mid-day session, jagati joins with the Vishvedevas

metres, of the Vedas, thus, are part of the process of
creation.)




6. Caklrpre tena rsayo manusya yajne jate pitaro


When the creation yajna of all time is
accomplished, thereby our ancient forefathers, seers and
ordinary mortals receive their being and strength of
identity, and, visualising them with the eye of the mind
and imagination, I honour and adore those who in times


of yore enact this yajna of creation.






Well versed in Vedic hymns of yajna and the
cosmic process of evolution, the verse forms of
Chhandas associated with divinities, and the
evolutionary stages of the cosmos, seven divine sages
of vision and wisdom, self-established in peace of mind
and soul, having realised the holy path of the ancients
and following in their footsteps, realise the cosmic
process of divine evolution and live their life to
perfection like the driver holding reins of his chariot
and controlling his horses in the right direction.

A one horse cart never reaches the destination

protectors of the good, valuable and auspicious, well
enjoying the soma taste of life together, help and assist
Indra, ruler of life in the world, in the struggles of life
and society against the demonic forces of want, violence

nation with bold actions and enjoy the peace, prosperity

O Mitra and Varuna, lord of light and love, and
lord of sovereign judgement and freedom, you are both
sustainers of the earth and givers of peace and comfort

3. Adha cinnu yaddidhisamahe vamabhi priyam


And when we bear and bring liberal gifts of

20. Asavanyo asura suyata dyaustvam visvesam varu-


O Mitra, sun, life giving light and pranic energy,
that other, mother Infinity, has given you birth. O
Varuna, breath of life and cosmic air, you are the ruler
and life giver of the world. You, Mitra- Varuna, are the
head of the chariot of life, the cosmic yajna. You are the
antidote of death. Let not our yajna be vitiated even by
a remote touch of sin.





In this yajna instituted by the yajamana, who is
otherwise competent in his own right of strength, one
sin of omission would vitiate the performance if Mitra,
the sun, alone is invoked for oblations. The omission
vitiates the inner strength and others in the family unless
the other protector, Varuna, too is invoked. When this
other protector is invoked and served, no want or short
coming remains in the cherished body health of the
yajna, the yajaka and the yajaka’s family.


6. Yuvorhi mataditirvicetasa dyaurna bhumih






Mitra and Varuna, givers of light and
intelligence, known with special effort of the mind, your
mother power is eternal Nature, the giver of knowledge
about you is eternal Veda which washes the cover of
ignorance as heaven and earth wash away the evils of
darkness and want. The sun illuminates with rays of
light, the earth gives cherished wealth of food.






O Mitra and Varuna, givers of light and life
energy for positive action, be seated on the vedi of
cosmic yajna. Ascend the chariot strongly structured
and balanced, worthy of universal movement to fight
out those vociferous forces of the enemy poised against
us. You save the yajaka dedicated to the progress of
united humanity from sin. You save the yajamana of
intelligential and scientific yajna from going astray on
the path of evil and destructivity.

cloud, and when the mantras are chanted and you radiate

The sun in the midst of the regions of light
releases the energy flood of its rays, creating thereby a
complementary adversary for the mighty cloud which

omnipotent performer, controller of cosmic dynamics,
break the formidable concentrations of the wondrous
mighty collector’s hoard of living showers by the strike
of the catalytic operation of its natural law.

elements, and, adored and celebrated, destroys the
enemies of humanity by the lustre of his justice and


power.






Indra, heroic commander of irresistible force,
omnipresent and boundless, destroyer of evil and
darkness by his inviolable potential, is generous, reduces
the hurtful and promotes the progressive. The evil and
wicked fear the shattering thunderbolt of Indra who is
ever moving forward, illuminating and purifying, and
every day the morning moves his chariot for anew dawn

Mandala 10/Sukta 145
Sapatni-badhanam Devata, Indrani Rshi


The subject matter of this hymn at the surface
level is getting rid of a rival wife, and for that purpose
the speaker takes recourse to a herb also. Thus the hymn
reads like a spell cure and possibly with a magical herb.
But this approach would not do justice to the deeper
meaning of the hymn which is integration or re-
integration of personality with a single, undivided,
focussed interest in the pursuit of a definite goal of
positive value.


Split personality is a problem in modern times.
So is schizophrenia, a devastating disease. The cure can
be both herbal and psychological. The word ‘Upanishat’
helps us to read the hymn in this Vedic direction of
practical yoga in which sanative herbs, mental
concentration and spiritual faith all play an important



role (refer Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, 4, 1.).

1. Imam khanamyosadhim virudham balavattamam.


I dig out this luxuriant and most powerful herb
by which one can annul a rival fascination and by which
the pursuant can recover a single, all absorbing love for

of peace, patience and courageous vitality, transform
me to concentrate on my one and only love. Throw off
my evil fascination. Let me be with my master spirit of
life.





O soma, you are higher, more efficacious. I also
am higher than the fascination, greater than all others
who are superior, generally speaking. May that which
is my rival be lower than the lowest fascinations.

4. Nahyasya nama grbhnami no asmin ramate jane.


I do not even think of its name. No one entertains
this human distraction, no one is distracted by this
human fascination. We throw this remote fascination
far off at the farthest.






I am patient, challenging and victorious. O
soma, you too are unassailable, you and I, both
challenging and victorious, we shall subdue the rival.




6. Upa te’dham sahamanamabhi tvadham sahtyasa.


O soma, O spirit of peace, O spiritual knowledge
of the Upanishad, I love you at heart and hold on to you
in faith, patient and victorious as you are. I hold on to
you with a determined mind. May your spirit radiate
and come to me like the mother cow hastening to the
calf and water rushing straight down to the lake.

such message can be a message of love, friendship and
cooperation, or it can be a message of disaster. In either
case humanity must respond and make proper
preparations to face the consequences. In modern terms,
it is an ambassadorial hymn.

appreciation, and exhilarating him with choice

reach nothing but the ultimate reality at the centre of
the radiating rays of existence.








Patanga, the soul flying in various forms, bears
the eternal Vak, divine Word, at the depth of its mind.
Vak is the voice which Parameshvara, sustainer of the
voice and the universe, speaks to the soul at the heart of
existence. That same resonant and refulgent voice and
its awareness, wise visionaries retain, hear and enjoy in
the state of samadhi communion at the centre of the
ultimate truth of existence.






I see this retainer of the divine Voice and its
senses and mind, the soul ranging over different paths

aman of versatile mind and boundless possibilities who

enlightenment, received the pure, applied, beatific and
life giving Word of the Veda, the first, original and
eternal gift of the lord of omniscience into his yajna of
cosmic creation, from Agni, sustainer of the light of
knowledge, Vayu, vibrant sage with passion and strong
will, Savita, i.e., Aditya, brilliant and inspiring like the
sun, and Angiras, the sage inspiring as omnipresent
Vishnu and breath of life.


(This Vasishtha, the brilliant disciple of the four
sages, Agni, Vayu, Aditya and Angira, who then became
the teacher of the Vedas, was Brahma. Swami
Brahmamuni explains this interpretation of this mantra
in his commentary on Rgveda and cites authoritative
evidence from the Brahmana works. Swami Dayanand
explains the cosmic process of creative evolution and
Vedic revelation in his Introduction to his Commentary
on the Vedas, Rgvedadi Bhashya Bhumika, saying on
Vedic and ancient authority that the Vedas were first
revealed to four sages: Rgveda to Agni, Yajurveda to




Vayu, Samaveda to Aditya, and Atharva veda to Angira.
Brahma, the brilliant disciple and later the inspired
teacher, learnt the Veda from these four sages and passed
on this knowledge to his disciples.)






Those sages, i.e., Agni, Vayu, Aditya and Angira,
received this knowledge, which was deeply hidden and
perfectly preserved in the bottomless depths of
omniscience of creative Divinity, and which is, still,
deeply preserved in the depths of the human mind at
the frequency of the cosmic mind, from the Lord
Supreme that is all sustainer, self-refulgent, giver of light
and life, immanent and omnipresent. From them and
from the lord self-refulgent Agni, then, the disciple
inspired with will and passion, Bharadvaja, receives and
practically extends the knowledge which has, after all,

all these, Agni, Vayu, Aditya and Angira, Brahma,
Bharadvaja and others that follow ultimately receive
the knowledge, light and warmth of life, from the
Supreme Sun, self-refulgent sustainer, giver of light,
giver of life, omniscient, omnipresent Divinity.

bestow good health and prosperity on him.




2. Narasamso no’vatu prayaje Sam no astvanuydajo


May Agni, adorable favourite of humanity,
protect and promote us in Prayaja yajna, the
