PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. 

The demy 8vo size of this second Edition of the .White 
Yajurveda by Griffith has been specially selected, at the request 
of the public at large, to bring it into conformity with the size 
of the other Vedas, by the same author, and is in the main a 
reprint from the previous Double Crown i6 vo edition which was 
published in the year 1899 and so well received in all scholarly 
circles. Owing to a variety of causes, the publication of the 
second edition, though needed for a long time, was considerably 
delayed, to the great disappointment of a large circle of readers 
in India as well as abroad. The Publishers are now glad to 
present •■he second edition of this great work to the lovers of 
Sanskrit literature throughout the world. Every attempt has 
been made to follow the first edition scrupulcusly excepting that 
the pagings, from beginning to end, owing to change in size, 
have been entirely altered.

PREFACE. 


The .Yajurvedv — derived from the roots yaj^ to sacrifice or 
worship, at\d vid, to know, — is the Knowledge of Sacrifice or 
Sacrificial Texts and Formulas as distinguished from the Rig* 
veda or Knowledge of Recited Praise, ftie S^maveda or Know- 
ledge of Chanted Hymns, and the Atharva or Brajjmaveda 
which is the Knowledge of Prayer, Charm, and Spells. Though 
ranking second in the Indian enumeration of the VedAt and 
containing much that is of very ancient origin, its compilation 
in its present form, exhibiting as it does the almost complete 
development castes and inixt castes and considerable advance 
in arts and sciences, trades, handicrafts and occupations, is 
evidently of later date than that even of the Atharva. The 
Saiuhit't or Collection of its hymns, texts, and formulas, con- 
stituting the hymn-book and prayer-book of the Adhvarjiu 
priests as distinguished from the Hotar, the Udgutar, and the 
Brahn\jin, the special priests, respectively, of the three other 
Vedas, owes its origin to the increasing multiformity and compli- 
cation of the Indi.an ritual and the recogniied insufficiency of the 
simple .and unsystematically arranged Collection of Rigveda 
Hymns to meet the recjuirements of the performers of various 
essentially important rites and ceremonies. 

The* Yajurveda, owing to a schism among its earliest teachers 
and their followers, was divided into two distinct Sainhitas 
or Collections called —probably from the names of the Rishis 
or inspired Seers who are respectively their reputed compilers 
—the Taittiriya and the Vujas.aneya or Vajasaneyi ; the former 
and older being knowd also by the title Krishna or Black — 
probably from its dark oi* obscure appearance, the collection 
of sacrificial texts and formulas bejng perplexingly intermingled 
with the Bnihmana or exegeticiil portion whicl\ explains them

aad teaches their ritual application— and the latter being 
called Sukla or White, the revised, systematic and clear Collection 
containing the text^ and formulas by themselves with a totally 
distinct Brahmaiia, the Satapatha, as an appendix. In the two 
divisions, besides these essential points of diflTerence, are found 
occasional verbal and orthoepic variations which are generally 
of little importance. The order of rites and ceremonies is 
substantially identical, but the White contains a few more texts 
than the Black. 

The Samhita of the White Yajurveda consists of forty 
Adhy&yas or Books containingf, with frequent repetitions of 
tho wme text, about two thousand verses. A large portion of 
these ere Bichas or Strophes borrowed — frequently with varia- 
tions — from the Rigveda, an 1 •iometini 's from the .\tharva : 
these, of course, are metrical. Nearly equal in quantity are 
the Yajus texts or sacrificial formulas— the most characteristic 
portion, from which the Veda derives its name — composed in 
measured prose ‘ which rises now and then,’ as Professor Weber 
observes, ‘ to a true rhythmical swing,’ and long passages, such 
as the lists of victims to be tied up and dedicated at the Asva- 
medha and the Purushamcdha, which are necessarily in the 
simplest prose. 

For further inforination with regard to this Veda the reader 
should consult Professor Weber’s History of Indian I.iterature 
(English Translation by John Mann and Theod-ir Zachariae ; 
Triibner’s Oriental Series) ; Professor Max Miiller's History of 
Ancient Sanskrit Literature ; f’rofessor J. Fggeling’s Introduc- 
tion, Vol. XII, of the Sacred Boo^s of tho East, or, for a briefer 
account, Mrs. Manning’s Ancient and Mediaeval India, Vol. I. 
pp. 107 — 109. 

My translation follow.s the fine edition (^f the White Yajur- 
veda or VAjasancyi-Sanhiri, in the ttvu recensions — the Madh- 
yandina and the Kai.iva--, with Mahidbara’.s Commentary, the 
Vedadipa, or Lamp of Knowledge, written towards the close of 
the sixteenth , century, published under the patronage of the

Hooourable Court of Directors oE the East India Compaojf in 
1849 at Berlin by Dr. Albrecht Weber, at that time Docent 
of the Sanskrit language at that University. This excellent 
edition consisting* of three Parts the latter two of which contain 
the Satapatha-Briihmana in the Mudhyandina recension with 
extracts from the Commentaries of Sayana, Harisv&min, and 
DvivedaCganga, and the Srautra>Sutra of Kiitytiyana with extracts 
from the Commentaries of Karaa and Yajfiikadeva, has not been 
reprinted and is now practically unobtainable. In India the 
text of the M 4 dhyandina recension with Nlahidhara’s Commentary 
has been issued in a cheap form at Calcutta by Pandit tjibinanda 
Vidyas'lgara, B.A., Superintendent of the Free Sanskrit College 
College, of which a second edition appeared in 1893 ; and a 
lithographed edition of the text with a Hindi translation of 
Mahidhara’s Commentary was published in 1874, Besma in 
the North-Western Provinces, ty R.lja Giriprasada Varman ofe 
that place. A cheap edition of the text, in unbound MS, form, 
has been published at Bombay. 

No separate translation of the whole Saiuhita or Collection 
of Texts and Formulas has appeared in any European language. 
It was Professor Weber’s intention, as signified in his History of 
Indian Literature, to bring out a translation giving the ceremonial 
belonging to each verse, together with a full glossary, but 
‘ this promise has not been fulfilled, owing to the pressure of 
other labours.’ This scholar h.ad previously published a Latin 
translation with annotations in the same language, of Books 
IX. and X. in his V'njasaneya-Sanhitae Specimen (Breslau, 1846), 
and more recently a German version of Book XVI. in Indische 
Studirn II. pp. 14 tV., and of the list of men tnd women to be 
dedicated at the Purushamedha in his treatise on Human Sacrifice 
aipong Indians of the Vcdic Age reprinted in his Indische Streifen 
1. pp. 76-84. Of Book XL. as an Upanishad there are several 
translations into English. 

Moreover, nearly the whole gf the fi(st eighteen Books has 
been incorporated —dissected and explained clause by clause — in

able translation of this vast work by Professor J ulius Eggeling is 
now nearly completed in the Sacred Books of the East, four 
volumes (Xlt., XXVI., XLI., XLIII. of that series) having 
already appeared, and the concluding volume (XLV) being in the 
press. From this translation — which, but for its bulk and 
costliness would make half of my work superfluous — and from 
Professor Eggeling’s annotiitions, [ have derived the greatest 
assistance, and most gra^fully record my obligations. 


All that 1 have attempted to do is to give a faithful trans- 
lation, to the best of my ability, of tiiu texts and sacrificial 
formulip of the Veda, with just sullicient commentary, chiefly 
from Mahidhara to make them intelligible. Much additional

Thee* for food. Thee for vigour. Ye are breezes. 

To noblest work God Savitar impel you. Inviolable ! 
swell his share for Indra. 

No thief, no evil-minded man shall master you rich in 
offspring, free from pain and sickness, 

Be constant, numerous to this lord of cattle. Guard 
thou the cattle of the Sacrihcer. 


Books I. and II. contain the texts and formulas required at 
the New and Full Moon sacrifices, the regular performance of 
which is obligatory on the Br^hnianical householder during thirty 
years from his Agny&dhiina or ceremonial establishment of bis 
own sacrificial fires ; or, according to some authorities, during 
his whole remaining life. Each of these sacrifices usually 
requires two days for its performance, the work of the first day 
consisting in introductory ceremonies such as the preparation of 
the Ahavaniya and Daksbii.i&gni, or Eastern and Southern 
fire-places, for the reception of fire from the Western fireplace, 
the G&rhapatya or Householder’s hearth ; the solemn taking of 
the vrata or vow of fasting and absiention during the sacrifice ; 
and the performance by the sacriiicer of the evening Agnihotra or 
burnt oblation of milk. On this day also* the day before the 
appearnce of the New or the Full moon, the Adhvaryu priest, who 
performs the practical part of the sacrifice, cuts a branch from a 
Parpa or Pal&sa tree (Butea Frondosa), or from a Sami tree 
(Acacia Suma), trims it and uses it as a switch to drive the calves 
away from the rows whose milk is to form part of the offerings 
of the next day's special ceremony. 

I Thee : ‘I cut’ understood. The Pal&!«a branch is addressed 
by the Adhvaryu. For food : as instrumental in obtaining the 
seasonable rain and the good harvest which trill result from the 
sacrifice. Thw for vigour : M cut or trim,’ in order to obtain the 
bodily strengfth which a sufficience of food may be expected to bring. 
Ye : the Adhvaryu touches and addresses the calves. Breezea : 
as the winds purify the aground, so do ye with your droppings 
which are used for smearing, and so cleansing, the floors of 
houses ; or, perhaps, meaning 'iniruders’* preventing the milkiQg- 
of the cows ; or, free to wander where you will, and then to

vasu meaning originally good, kind, wealthy. This paviti-afn or 
strainer, made of two or thite blades of Ku-n grass or Oarbha 
(Poa Cynosuroides), used at relicious ceremonies, is fastened with 
this formula on the hid.len I'ala-a or Sami branch (verse I). Thou 
art heaven : he puts the nthitl! or cooking-pot on the Gurhapatya 
fire, and addresses it. He calls it heaven because as an imple- 
ment of sacrifice it aids in pr jducing ruin. Earth : ffs being 
made of clay. MfUurisvan'fi caldron : .1 fanciful expression for 
the atmosphere ■ t mid-rep ion of air, MAtari^van being here

addressed.

sacrifice.

3. In reply to this question, tiirice repeated, of tne Adhvaryu, 
the milker (who may be any one above the rank of a Sudra) 
mentions the ordinary name of each of the three rows, iuid the 
Adhvaryu gives her a .cacrificial name, th'^reby imparting to her 
the virtues and powers whicti the nSme signifies. Visvdyu : 
All-jife-containing Visvakarman : ^ll-efTtcting. I Uva lhayna : 
All-supporting. Thee : the milk which is now removed from the 
fire. The mixture is fhen co^red over with a vessel not made of 
earth, and entrusted to the guardian.ship of Vi.shnu or the sacrifice.

Books IX and X. contain the formulas required for the per- 
formance of two important modifications of the Soma sacrifice, 
the Vijapeya, Draught of Strength or Cup of Victory, and the 
Rajasuya, Inauguration or Consecration of a King. For the 
Viijapeya, see Sacred Books of the East, XLI. pp. i — 40 ; 
Hillebrandt. Ritual-Litteratur, pp. 141 — 143 ; Weber, I'berden

United are ye twain : with bliss unite me. Parted are ye :

Yea, Horses ! at our praises of the Waters grow ye 
fleet and strong. 

Whatever wave, O ye celestial Waters, wealth -giving, 
towering high, and swiftly rashing, is yours, therewith 
may this man win him riches. 

7 It was the wind, or it was thought, or the Gandharvas 

twenty-seven — 

These at the first harnessed the horse : they set the 
power of speed in him. 

8 Steed, being yoked grow wind-swift : be beauteous as 

Indra’s right-hand steed. 

4 He draws the fifth cup. Handleless : Or noseless, or jaw- 
less ; without spouts or side-handles. Ye twain : a cup of Soma 
and another of Sura, a kind of wine or beer made from rice or 
barely with a kind of leaven to make it ferment. See Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, p. 280. 

5 Here begin the formulas for the chariot-racing which is a 
characteristic and important part of the Vijapeya. The Sacrificer 
adurusses the Chariot which he takes down from its stand, draws 
to the south of the Chstvala or pit, and places by the altar. On 
whom : as Earth. 

6 He takes water and sprinkles the chariot horses, reciting the 
text from A. V. I. 4. 4., the first line of which is taken from R. 
V. I. 23. 19. Amrit : nectar or ambrosia.

the region of thy heart. In battle : or, at the gathering (of the 
Gods at sacrifice), according to the Satapatha-Brahma^a. 
BrihatpatVs portion : a mess of boiled wild-rice, dedicated to 
Brihaspati the representative of the priesthood. The horses are 
made to smell it in order to assure their victory. 

10 The Brahman mounts a chariot- wheel placed on a post, 
with the following line of text if the Sacrificer is a Brahman. 
Indra : as the representative of the Kshatra or nobility ; this 
part of the text being used when the Sacrificer is a Riijanya, a 
man of the princely, nobler or military class. The third line also 
is to be used when the Brahman descends from the wheel, if 
the Sacrificer be a Briihman and the fourth when he is a R&janya. 

Seventeen being the number sacred to Praj&pati, whose 
favour is to be won in the ceremony, seventeen four-horse chariots 
have been prepared and assembled, the goal round which they 
have tu turn being the branch of an Udumbara tree (Ficus 
Glomerata) planted in the ground at a distance of .seventeen bow- 
shots from the starting-place. 

1 1 The Brahman beats one of the seventeen drums ranged 
along the edge of the altar ground, 'und recites the text, the rest 
of the drums being* considered to be simultaneously beaten.*

14 Bound by the neck and at the flanks and in the mouth, 

that vigorous Courser lends new swiftness to his speed. 
Drawing himself together as his strength allows, Dadbi- 
kr^s speeds along the windings of the paths. All-hail 1 

15 His pinion, rapid runner, fans him on his way, as of a 

bird that hastens onward to*its aim,

Dadhikravan’s side as he speeds on with might. Ail-

that has been beaten, and the others in silence. Y our league :

the running horses with two verses taken respectively from R.V. 
IV. 40. 4, 3. Dadhikras, or in the crude form, Dadhikr 4 ; a

horses are made to smell before the race and to drink after it. 
See verse 9- 

19 The Sacrificer having dismounted from the chariot touches 
the mess of wild-rice and recites the text. Father : Heaven.

chiefly for building up with about lo.Soo bricks, all laid with 
specal consecrating texts, the Uttaravedi or High Altar which 
represents the Universe and is indentified with Agni himself. This 
ceremony, called the Aghichayana requires a year fur its complete 
performance and is of corresponding importance (see Sacred Books 
of the East, XLIII., Introduction). The High Altar is construct- 
ed in the shape of an butspread bird, probably an eagle or a falcon.

I loose for thee as from the midst of Ayus. Sped forward 
now, eat thou the food we offer. 

To Fortune, her who hath done this, be homage. 

66 Establisher, the gatherer of treasures, he looks with might 

on every form and figure. 

Like Savitar the God whose Uws are constant, like Indra 
he h^th stood where meet the pathways. 

67 Wise, through desire of bliss with Gods, the skilful bit^d 

the traces fast, and la> the yokes on either side. 

68 Lay on the yokes and fasten well the traces : formed is 

the furrow, sow the seed within it. 

Through song may we find hearing fraught with plenty : 
near to the ripened grain approach the sickle. 

69 Happily let the shares turn up the ploughland, happily go 

the ploughers with the oxen ! 

65 He throws down on the iTarther side of the bricks the 
suspensory sling, the cord of the gold plate (see i) the two reed 
mats fa) and the wooden seat (2), and addresses the Sacrificer 
with the text. From the midst of Ayus : from the G&rhapatya 
hearth which is the middle of Agni : Mahidbara. 'Ayus may 
rather baye to be taken in the sense of 'life’ or ‘vital power’ : 
Eggeling. Sped forward : by being freed from the bonds of 
Nirriti. To Fortune : he pours out a jarful of water. 

*66 The Brahman*priest, the Sacrihcer, and the Adbvaryu 
return to the sacrificial enclosure from the place where the Nirriti 
bricks were laid down, and the Adhvaryu stands worshipping 
Agni, in the form of the G&rhapatya hearth, with the texts, taken 
with variations, from R. V. X. 139. 3. Pathways : the R. V. 
has dhandnum, that is in the meeting or conflict for booty ; and 
Mahidbara explains path'mdm, of the pathways, by ‘with robbers 
or infesters of the way.’ 

67 Standing behind the right cr southern hip of Agni or the 
Fire-altar, the Adhvaryu addresses the plough to which oxen are 
being yoked for the purpose, with two texts from R. V. X. 10 '.

pleasing the Gods ; 'with mind devoted to the Gods’ : Eggeling. 

69 On the site of Altar, near the enclosing stones, he ploughs 
four furrows, south, west, north, and east, with four texts, ope for 
each furrow. The first is from A V. III. 17. 5, the first

Welcome this fountain redolent of sweetness. O Courser,

89 Forth from the ocean sprang the wave of sweetness : 

together with the stalk it turned to Amrit, 

That which is holy oil’s mysterious title : but the Gods' 
tongue IS truly Amrit’s centre. 

90 Let us Declare aloud the name of Ghrita, and at this 

sacrifice held it up with homage. 

So let the Brahman hear the praise we utter. This hath 
the four-horned Buffalo emitted. 

91 Four are his horns, three are the feet that bear him : his 

'heads are two, his hands <ire seven in number. 

Bound with a' triple bond the Bull roars loudly : the 

• mighty God hath entered into mortals. 

89 — 99 Taken from R. V. IV. 58., a hymn in praise of Ghrita 
or Clarified Butter. It would be fruitless, as Prof. Lgdwig 
remarks, to repeat all the various explanations which SAya'iia gives 
of the first line of this stanza : they only show the utter uncertainty 
of tradition in reference to»the passage. For instance samudra, 
ocean, is said to mean sacrificial fire ; or celestial fire ; or the 
firmament ; or the udder of the Cow ; and >‘irini, wave, may 
accordingly mean reward ; or rain ; or butter Prof. Ludwig thinks 
that the sense ot the stanza may be : the life giving essence which 
develops itself out of the world-ocean turns into Soma in the Moon; 
but it is neither of these two, but the tongue of the Gods (Agni ?) 
from which the Amrit proceeds and to which it returns. But see 
A. Hillerbrandt, Vedisebe Mythologic, I. 321, 322. 

90 The Brahmun : according to Mabidhara, the titvij or 
priest. Probably Agni is meant. The last half-line of the stanza 
is translated, after Sa)aiia, by Professor Wilson : 'the fair-com- 
plexioned deity perfects this rite,’ the epithet 'four-homed’ being 
transferred to ‘Brahman ’ The God may be called a buffalo 
(gaura) Bos Gaurus, as a type of extraordinary strength. Mahi« 
dbara explains gaura by gajna, sacrifice, having four horns, that 
is, four officiating priests. 

91 Four are his horns : the four horns of Agni as identified 
with sacrifice are^said by S&yana to be the tour Veda.s, and, if 
identified with Aditya. the four cardinal points. The threo/eet 
are, in the former case, the three duly sacrifices, in the latter, 
morning, noon, and evening. The two heads are, in the former 
case, the Rrahmaudana and the Pravurgya ceremonies, in the 
latter, day and night. Similarly, tke seven hands are explained, 
alternatively, as the seven metres offihe Veda or the seven rays 
of the Sun ; and the triple bond as the Mantra, Kalpa, and 
Brdhmana, prayer, ceremonial, and rationale of tbe Veda, or the 
three regions, heaven, firmament, and earth. The Steer is, either

92 That oil in triple shape the Gods discovered laid down 

within the Cow, conceal' d by Paois. 

Indra produced one shape, Sfirya another : by their own 
power they fortiied the third from Vena. 

93 From inmost reservoir in countless channels flow down 

these rivers which the foe beholds not. 

I look upon the streams of oil descending, and lo I the 
Golden Reed is there among them 

94 Like rivers our libations flow together, cleansing them* 

selves in inmost heart and spirit. 

The streams of holy oil pour swiftly downward like the 
wild beasts that ily before the bowman. 

95 As rushing down the rapids of a river, flow swifter than 

the wind the vigorous currents. 

'fh^ streams of oil in swelling fluctuation like a red courser 
bursting through the fences. 

96 Like women at a gathering fair to look on and gently 

smiling, they incline to Agni. 

The streams of holy oil attain the fuel, and J^tavedas 
joyfully receives them. 

97 As maidens deck themselves with gay adornment to join 

the bridal feast, I now behold them. 

Where Soma flows and sacrifice is ready, thither the streams 
of holy oil are running. 

as sacrifice or Adit) a, the pourcr down of rewards, and the loud 
roaring is the sound of the repetition of the texts of the Veda. 
Mahidhara’s explanation differs from that uf Sayana. The four 
horns are priests ; or noun*, verbs, prepositions, and participles ; 
the three feet are the Vedas, or the first, second, and the third 
persons, or the past, present and future tenses ; the two heads 
are two sacrifices, or the agent and object ; the seven hands are 
the metres or the cases of the noun ; and the thiee bonds are the 
three dail> sacrifices, or the .'■ingular, dual and plural numbers. 

92 In triph shape : as milk, curds, and butter, according 
to Sayana. The meaning seems to be that Indra, Siirya, and^ 
Vena (who is probably Agni), Restored the power of the elements 
of sacrifice respectively in*!waven, the firmament, and the earth, 
liter they had been renders ineffectual for a time by the malig* 
nant Patiis.

the firmament, in which Agni is present as lightning. Within 
the heart : as Vaisv&nara, belonging to all men. Within all life: 
as the vital principle, or heat. The wave is the flowing butter of 
the oblation.

Books XIX — XXI — Contain the formulas of the Sautrima^i, 
a sacrifice originally instituted to expiate and counteract the evil 
effects of excessive indulgence in Soma-drinking. See X. 31. 
The ceremony is prescribed as a means of obtaining general 
eminence ; for a dethroned king to procure his restoration, for a 
Kshatriya to assure victory ; for a Vai-ya to acquire cattle and 
wealth. It consist*; mainly in the offering, to the Alvins, Saras- 
vati and Indra, of Sura a spirituous liquor concocted of ^aahpa 
(busked rice or yuu.ig grass}, tokmun (g.’een barley) and I'ljd 
(parched grain) ground up with some roots to #erve as yeast, and 
the liquor of two Odau is or messes of rice, and Sy.imdk'i or millet 
boiled in water, the mixture being called M.isara. The prototype 
of the sacrifice is the cure ot Indra, by Sarasvati and the Asvins, 
when he was suffering trom over-indulgence in bis favourite 
beverage. The name is derived from butr&man, the Good Deli-

enjoy their gracious loving'kindness. 

51 Our ancient Fathers who deserve the Soma, who cam^ 

most noble, to our Soma, banquet — 

With these let Yama, yearning' with the yearning, 
rejoicing eat our offerings at bis pleasure. 

52 Thou, Soma, art preeminent for wisdom : along the 

straightest path thou art our leader. 

Our prudent Fathers by thy wisdom, Soma, dealt out 
among the Gods their share of treasure. 

53 For our sage Fathers, Soma Pavamdna, of old performed 

by thedT their sacred duties. 

Ifighting unvanquished, open the enclosures,: enrich us 
with large gitts of steeds and heroes. 

54 Associate with the Fathers thou, O Soma, hast spread 

thyself abroad through earth and heaven. 

So with oblation let us serve thee, Indu, and So let us 
bec(. me the lords of riches. 

55 Fathers who sit on < sacred grass, come help us : these 

offerings we have made for you ; accept them.

us health and strength without a trouble.

a son and progeny from Vishnu.

Still vikramanam : is an uniiitelfigpble expression in this

to be a waterspout in a lake, and * with toam ’ to mean * together

derived from na and much, * not loosing ’ ‘ Holdfast ’, makes 
him a demon who withholds the seasonable rain.

The Book contains an exact enumeration of the animals 
that are to be tied to the sacrificial stakes and in the inter- 
mediate spaces, with the names of the deities or deihed entities 
to which they are severally dedicated. The principal stake, 
the eleventh and midmost of the twent>-one, called the Agnishtha 
because it stands nearest to the sacriHcial fire, is mentioned 
first. About fifteen victims are bound to each of these stakes, 
all domestic animals, the total number being 327. In the 
spaces between the*stakes 282 wild animals, from the elephant 
and the rhinoceros to the bee and the fly, are temporarily 
confined, to be freed when the ceremony is concluded, bringing 
the total number of assembled animals up to 609. There is, 
perhaps, some exaggeration in the number, and some almost 
impossible animals are mentioned, but it must be remembered 
that the Asvamedha was a most important tribal solemnity 
of rare occurrence and that no effort would be spared to assure 
its performance with all possible splendour. 

Several of the wild animals cannot be identified. Some 
of the names are conjecturally rendered and some are left in 
their native forms. The Commentator is not of much assistance 
in doubtful cases, < a kind of be»t ’ or * a kind of bird ’ being 
aU the information that he has to give.

three in the waters, three within the ocean. 

To me thou seimest Varuna, O Courser, there where 
they say is thy sublimest birthplace. 

16 Here, Courser, are the places where they groomed 

thee ; here are the traces of thy hooves as winner. 

Here have I seen the auspicious reins that guide thee, 
which those who guard the holy Law keep safely. 

17 Thyself from far I recognized in spirit, a Bird that from 

below'flew through the heaven. 

1 saw thy head still soaring, striving upward by*paths 
unsoiled by dust, pleasant to travel. 

18 •Here I beheld thy form matchless in beauty, eager to

than he, though swift as thought, was Indra. 

The Gods came only to the oblation-banquet of him 
who mounted first of all the Courser. 

21 Symmetrical in flank, with rounded haunches, mettled

Put forth their strength like swans in lengthened order

Be thou victorious with un wounded bod;y : so let the

39 With Bow let us win kine, with Bow the battle, with 

Bow be victors in our hot encounters. 

The Bow brings grief and sorrow to the foeman : armed 
with the Bow may we subdue all regions. 

40 Close to his ear, as fain to speak, She presses, holding her 

well-loved Friend in her embraces. 

Strained on the Bow, She whispers like a woman — this 
Bow-string that preserves us in the combat. 

41 These, meeting like a woman and her lover, bear, mother- 

like, their child upon their bosom. 

May the two Bow-ends, starting swift asunder scatter, in

44 Horses whose hoofs rain dust are neighing loudly, yoked

With their forefeet descending on the foemen, they, never

45 Car -bearer is the name of his oblation, whereon are laid 

his Weapons and his Armour. 

So let us here, each day that passes, honour the helpful 
Car with hearts exceeding joyful. 

46 In sweet association lived the fathers who gave us life, 

profound and strong in trouble, 

Unwearied, armed with shafts and wondrous weapons, 
free, real heroes, conquerors of armies. 

47 The Br&hmans, and the Fathers meet for Soma draughts, 

and, graciously inclined, unequalled Heaven and Earth. 

42 With many a son : the quiver is called the father of sons 
and daughters, it is said, because the words signifying arrow are 
both masculine and feminine. 

45 Car^earer'. rathavahanam a platform, stand, or truck 
on which the chariot is placed when not in use*. The word seems 
in this place *to mean also the oblation offered by the warrior to 
the ideal war-chariot personified, or to a tutelary deity of chariots. 

46 There is no verb in this stanza, and the only substantive, 
pitara/i, fathers, is explained by both Commentators as pdlayi- 
tdrah, guards, defenders, that is, apparently, those who attend 
the chariot of the chief. Professor Wilson, following Sayaria, 
translates : *The guards (of the chariot), revelling in the savoury 
(spoil), distributors of food, protectors in calamity, armed with 
spears, resolute, beautifully, arranged, strong in arrows, invincible, 

of heroic valour, robust, and conquerors of numerous hosts.* 

• 

47 The Brdhmans and the Fathers : or, perhaps, the 
sacerdotal Fathers. The stanza, which is gsammatically difficult, 
seems out of place.

Books XXX. and XXXI. treat of the Purusbamedha or 
Human Sacrifice, an old-established custom among almost all 
nations of antiquity. The ceremony was to be performed by a 
Brahman or a R&janya, and wa«< expected to obtain for the Sacri- 
ficer universal preeminence and every blessing which the Horse* 
sacrifice might have failed to secure. The ritual resembles in 
many respects that of t >e Asvamedba ; man, the noblest victim, 
being adually or symbolically sacrificed instead of the Horse, and 
men and women of various tribes, figures, tcomplexions, charac- 
ters, and professions being attached to the sacrificial stakes in 
place of the tame and wild animals enumerated m Book XXIV. 
These nominal victims were afterwards rele.<sed uninjureo, ai d, 
so far as the text of the W lite Yajurveda goes, the whole oere- 
mon\ was merely emblematical, a type ot the allegorical self- 
immolation of Purusha, Embodied Spirit or the Cosmic Man.

BOOK THE THIRTY-FIRST. 


PURUSHA hath a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a 
thousand feet. 

Pervading earth on every side he Blls a space ten fingers 
broad. 

2 Purusha is in truth this All, what hath been and what yet 
shall be ; 

Lord, too, of immortality which waxes greater still by 
food. 

The ceremony is continued and concluded. The Brahman 
prifiht rjscites to the assembled human victims the famous 
Purusha Hymn (verse i— 16), taken, with transpositions and 
variations, from R. V. X. 90 (A. V. XIX. 6), which celebrates 
the mystical immolation of Purusha, the origin of all creation, 
of which the Purushamedha or Human Sacrifice is an emble- 
matical representation. 

1. Purusha : the Person, embodied spirit, or Man personi- 
fied and regarded as the soul and original source of the universe, 
the personal and lifegiving principle in all animated beings, is 
said to have a thousand, that is, innumerable heads, eyes, 
and feet, as being one with all created life. In the A. V. 
version arms has been substituted for heads to agree, apparently, 
with the numbers of eyes and feet A space ten fingers broad : 
the region of the heart of man wherein the soul was supposed 
to reside. Although, as the Universal Soul, Purusha pervades 
the universe, a.s the Individual Soul he is* enclo!>ed in a space 
of narrow dimensions Cf. A. V. IV. 16, 3. ‘Tie loins of 
Varui.ia are both the oceans, and this small drop of water, 
too, contains him ’ ; one of the recently discovered Log^a 
or Sayings of Jesus is to the same effect : ‘ cleave the wood, 
and thou wilt find me : lift the stone, and I am there.’ 

2. The second line is variously explained. The meaning of 
the words seems to be : he is lord of immortality or the immortal 
world of the Gods, which grows greater by food, that is, by 
the sacrificial offerings of men. According to Sftyana : he is» the 
lord or distributer of imnlortality because he becomes the visiblle 
world in order that living bejpgs may obtain the fruits of their 
actions and gain mo^sha or final liberation from their bonds j *he 
is also the lord of immortality ; itor he, mounts beyond (his 
owu condition) foi the food (of, living beings). ’-Wilson, 



m TBE TEXTS OF TBE [^OOJT XXXI. 

3 So mighty in his grandeur ; yea, greater than this is 

PArusha. 

All creatures are one fourth of him, three fourths eternal 
life in heaven. 

4 With three fourths Purusha rose up : one fdurth of him 

again was here. 

Thence he moved forth to every side over what eats not 
and what eats. 

5 From him VirAj was born ; again Purusha from VirAj was 

born. 

When born, he spread to west and east be 3 'ond the 
boundaries of earth. 


Colebrooke translates the line : * he is that which grows by 
nourishment, and he is the distributer of immort tlity. ’ Muir 
renders it by He is also the lord of immortality since* by 
food he expands. ’ According to the paraphrase in the 
BhAgavata Purdua, the meaning ot the last clause is : ‘ since 
he hath tran<;cended movtal nutriment. * Prof Ludwig’s 
version is : ‘ auch uber die un'.terbitchkeit gebietend [da er,] 
was durch speise [ist,] weit uberragt, ruling also over immortality, 
[since he] far transcends what [exists] through food ; but in 
his Commentary a somewhat different explanation is given. 
‘Ruling over immortality, he was all that grows by food. ’ — 
Peterson. 

3. Et^riwX Kf« : amt itam : immortality, or the immortal 
Gods. 

4 Over tohat eala not and what eat'. : over animate and 
inanimate creation. According to S.iyaiia and Mahidhara, over 
both classes of created things, those capable of enjoyment, that 
is, who can taste the reward and punishment ot good and evil 
actions, such as Gods, men, and lower animals, and those who 
are incapable thereof, such as mountains and rivers — chetanam, 
or conscious, nchetanam, or unconscious, creation. 

5 From him : or, from that, the ‘one>fourth’ mentioned in 
stanzas 3 and 4. Virdj, or, in the nominative form, Virat, is 
said to have come, in the form of the mundane egg, from Adi- 
Purusha, the primeval Purusha, or presiding Male or Spirit, 
who then entered into this egg, which 'he animates as its vitid 
soul or divine principle.’ Or VirAj m^y 'be the female counterpart 
of Purusha as Aditi of Daksha m X. 72. 4, 5.’ See Muir’s ex> 
haustive Note on tbjs passrge, 0 . S Texts, V. pp. 369, 370 ;

6 From that great Generel Sacrifice the dripping fat was 

gathereci ttp. 

He formed the creatures of the ajr and animals both wild 
and tame. 

7 From that great General Sacrifice l^Lichas and Sima 

hymns were born : 

Therefrom were spells and charms produced ; the Yajus 
had its birth from it. 

8 From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two 

rows of teeth : 

From it were generated kine, from it were goats and 
sheep produced. 

9 They blamed as victim on the grass Purusha born in 

earliest time. 

With him the Deities and all SAdhyas and Rishis 
saciificed. 

10 When the divided Purusha how many portions did they 

make ? 

What was his mouth ? what were his arms ? what are 
the names of thighs and feet ? 

11 The RrAhman was his mouth, of both his arms was the 

RAjanya made. 

His thighs became the Vaisya, from his feet the §ldra 
was produced. 


6 Dripping fat : ‘the mixture of curds and butter. ’ — Wilson. 
H€ : or. It ; the sacrificial victim Purusha, dr the sacred clurified 
butter. 

7 Ilickao : verses of praise and prayer for recitation. Sama 
hymns : psalms for chanting:. Spells and charms : magical 
incantations ; probably those of the later collection of the Atharva* 
veda. The Yajus : the Collection of Sacrificial formulas. 

9 Sa< hyas : see XXIV. 27 ; XXIX. ii ; XXX. 15. 

II The Brahman is called the mouth of Purusha as having 
the special privilege as a preist of addressing the Gods in prayer 
The arms of Purusha became the Rajanya, the prince and soldier 
who wields the sword and ^pear. His thighs, the strongest pa{t 
of his* body, became the agriculturist and tradesman, the chief 
supporters of society ; and hts feet, the emblems of vigour and 
acdvity, became the Siidra or labouring man on whose toil and 
industry all piosperity ultimately resls. Ttfis is the only passage 
ip the Rigveda which enumerates the four castes.

12 The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from u* 
eye the Sun had birth ; ® 

Viya and Pdoa from his ear, and from his mouth was 
Agni born. 

13 Forth from his navel came mid-air ; the sky was fashioned 

from his head ; 

Earth from his feet, and from his ear the Quartets. 
Thus they formed the worlds. 

14 When Gods performed the sacrifice with Purusha as 

offering 

Spring was the butter, Autumn the oblation. Summer 
was the wood. 

15 Then seven were his enclosing-sticks, his kindling-brands 

were three times seven, 

When Gods, performing sacrifice, bound as their victim 
Purusha. 

16 Gods, sacrificing, sacrificed the victim : these were the 

earliest holy ordinances. 

13 Cf. the creation-myth of the world-giant Ymir in Old 
Northern poetry. The hills are his bones, the sky his skull, the 
sea his blood, and the clouds his brains. See Corpus Poeticum 
Boreale, II. 468. 

15 Enclosing sticits ; See II. 3. Kindling brands : See II. 

4. Sayaiia explains paridhayah here as the seven sacred metres, 
or as six shallow trenches dug round the fire and an imaginary 
one round the Sun. Acct)rding to Mahidhara, the twenty-one 
kindling-brands are the twelve months, five seasons, the three 
worlds of earth, air ' and heaven, and the Sun. 

This pantheistic hymn, which is generally called the 
Purushasukta, is of comparatively recent origin, and appears to 
be an attempt to harmonize the two ideas of sacrifice and creation. 
For further information regarding it see Muir, O S. Texts, I 
pp. 6~ii, nnd V. 368—377, Prof. Max Muller, Ancient Sanskrit 
Literature, pp. 57of, and Dr. Schermin, Philosophische Hymnen

has also been translated by Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays,

This and the two following Books contain texts and formulas 
to be used at the performance of a Sarvamedha or Sacrifice for 
Universal Success and Prosperity, a ten.day ceremony that ranks 
higher and is considered to be more important than even the 
Punishamedha. After performing this ceremony the Sacrificer 
has to leave his home and retire to the wilderness for the rest of 
bis life. This Book is considered to be an Upanishad, entitled 
Tadeva from the first two words.

The lights’ one light that goeth to a distance, may that,

The peerless spirit stored in living' creatures, may that,

light which creatures have within them. 

That without which men do no single action, may that,

is, and what shall be hereafter. 

Whereby spreads sacrifice with seven Hotars, may that,

And all the thought of creatures is inwoven, may that,

skilful charioteer drives fleet-foot horses. 

Which dwells 'within the heart, agile, mast rapid, may

The fitst six verses of this supplementary Book constitute a 
hymn regarded as an Upanishad and called the ^ivasahkalpa, 
Right-intentioned, from the concluding words in each stanza.

Praise of Food, (in the shape of Soma). Trita : (see I. 23, note) 
a mysterious ancient deity frequently mentioned in the Rigveda, 
principally in connexion with Indra, Vayu, and the Maruts,^ His 
home is in the remotest part of heaven, and he is called Aptya, 
the Watery, that is, sprung from, or dwelling in, the sea of cloud 
and vapour. By Siiyana he is identified sometimes with VAyu, 
sometimes with Indra as the pervader of the three worlds and 
sometimes with Agni stationed in the three fire-receptacles. 
Mahidhara identifies him, without explanation, with Indra who is 
genarally regarded as the slayer of Vritra. See Macdonell, Vedic 
Mythology, pp. 67 —69.

associated with Aditi (Infinity or Eternity), the mother of the

of Created Beings. The D&ksh&yanas, or descendants of Daksha,

corpse. Cf. R. V. X. 14. 9. Hie : the deceased householder’s 
who in his life time duly worshipped the Gods with libations of 
Soma juice. 

2 Remains : the bones and ashes which are to be buried. 
Let the bulls be yoke'd : six in number, to a plough with which 
furrows are driven f^om the south or north side of the ground, 
to keep evil spirits at a distance. 

3 Four furrows are drawn, with a formula for each. 

4 Addressed to the various plants whose seeds he sows. The 
formula, taken from R. V. X. 97. 5, is repeated from XII. 79. 
Sacrificial vessels and implements are made of the Asvattha or 
Ficus Religiosa and the Pariia, Pal&sa, or Butea Frondosa, which 
are therefore said to be the home of plants used in religious 
ceremonies. 

5 The collected bones and ashes are laid down in the middle 
of'the prepared ground.

4 Ye who were born the earliest of creation. Ants ^ivine, 

This Book and the two that follow contain the formulas to 
be peed at the actual performance of the Pravargya ceremony, 
when the necessary animals, vessels, and implements have been 
brought to the sacrificial ground, and the propitiatory texts 
(Book XXXVI) have been recited by the priests, 

I 1 take thee : the wooden sacrificial spade, with which earth 
is to be dug to form two square beds for the chief Caldron, called 
Mah&vira and Gharma, to rest on. Woman : ahhHt spade, 
being feminine : see V. 22. note. 

3 Ileaven and Earth : the Adhvaryu takes up a lump of 
clay, the moisture of which represents the vapoury heaven, and 
the earthy portion the earth. The head of Makha : according 
to the legend related in the Satapatha and Panchavimsa Brahma- 
nas, Makha (who appears as a malignant demon in R. V. IX. 
101. 13 and perhaps X. 171. 2) was attending a sacrificial session 
with Agni, Indra and other Gods who agtbed to share among 
them any glory that should accrue from^ it. The glory came 
to Makha whP took it and was going to depart, but the Gods 
surrounded him and claimed their shares He stood leaning 
on his bow when the string (gnawed through by confederate 
ants, according to the S. Brahmana) gave way, and the bow-end, 
springing upwards, cut off his head. This head, replaced by the 
A'jvins, became the Pravargya, and when men offer this sacrifice 
they replace the head of Makha, See Muir, O. Sanskrit Texts, 
IV. pp. 124—129. Mahidhara, however, without allusion to 
this legend (which is somewhat differently related in the two 
Br4hmaiias), explains makha by yajna, sacrifice, the head^ or 
main essential of which itf the Mah 4 vira or chief caldron contain- 
ing the heated milk.

of the wonderful power, bestowed upon them by the Gods, of 
producing water wherever they di». See The Hymns of the 
Atbarva-veda, Vol. I. pp. 44 and 300, notes. A lump from a 
white ants’ nest is used in the Atharva-veda ritual in connexion 
with a charm for diarrhoea, and as an antidote against poison. 
See Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, Vol. VII. pp. 
482 — 484. An ant-hill has been employed also in the ritual of 
this Veda. See XI. 17, note. These white ants are addressed 
as ‘ the earliest of creation’, and it seems to be a fact that these 
Corrodentia or Pseudo-Neuroptera have been in existence fiom 
Carboniferous ages, while ants, which are Hymenopterous insects, 
do not occur before Tertiary times. See Chamber’s Encyclopaedia,

The Pramgya, which was originally, probably, a milk*offer-

l^igveda (V.30. 15. VII. 103.8), and the ritual (with formulas different 
from those of the Yajurveda) is described in the Aitareya-Brahmana 
which belongs to that Veda. See Haug,Ai.Br.II.4‘i— 51. The 
Caldron is also glorified in A.V.IV.11.1— 6. More details of 
the performance of the rite may be found in Prof. A. Hillebrandt’s 
Ritual-Litteratur, and in Sacred Books of the East, Vol. XLV.

directly connected with any sacrificial ceremonial. It ‘is pro-

those entirely neglecting them. It belongs at all events to a 
very advanced stage of speculation as it assumes a Lord (ts) of

imagination is known to travel to the world of Brahmi even in 
a second, and the Self-Atmi-seems to arrive there previously. 
Because Atma or Brahma — Intelligence Absolute — which is the 
basis of all perception, imagination and thought • and as such

can the Mind function at all ? The Devaa : here ^meaning the

Thus from the sages have we heard who have declared 
this lore to us. 

11 The mail who knows Sambh^tiand Vinft$a simultaneously, 

He, by VinA$a passing deatn, gains by Sambhdti endless life. 

9 In order to enjoin the combined worship of Asambhfiti 
and Sambhuti, their separate worship is condemned Asamihuti 
is, according to Sri Saiikara, undeveloped Prakriti, Nature iir its 
causal or geroiiiiii state when it has not evolved as the universe 
which is the effect It is also ''alhd tanas, darkness or chaos. 
This worship is mere blindnefis and ignorance, aad its adherents 
fall into corresp'inding darkness. Sanbhuti : explained by Sri 
Sankara as the manifestation of Brahma as Brahml the pheno- 
menal Croat jr, called Hiranyagarbha the Golden Germ, or Praj&- 
pati. See R. V. X. 121. According to Mahidhara’s first 
explanation, Asambhuti is the denial of a new birth or 
existence after death, and SambhuM is the exclusive assertion of 
that belief, devotion to which will produce excess in the practice 
of Karma. 

10 The text now declares the separate fruit of each element 

of the cumdined worship of Undeveloped NatureandHiraoyagarbha 
in order to teach tneir combination, having first condemned the 
cults practised sepamtely. From Sambhava : from the cult of 
Sambhava which is the same as Sambhuti in verse 9, or Hiranya- 
garbha ; Unlevelopef Nature or Asambhuti. The 

result of the former cult is the attainment of certain supernatural 
powers called Sidihis which enabi: thiir possessor to increase or 
reduce his size and weight tj any extent at his pleasure, etc. 
Eight of these faculdes are usually enumerated. The worship of 
Prakri.i results in absorpeijn into Prakriti. Each, therefore, fails 
to attain the object to be desired, redintegration in the Supremi 
Self.. 

; n Sambhuti: standing for Asanbhuti, say the Commen- 
tators, by aphaeresis, and so meaning Undeveloped Natuie 
Vin'isa : (Destruction) that is, HiraiiyLgarbha. The combination 
oftbutwocuhs is niwexprcfsly enjoined, since thi fruits can 
be obtained only by ode an^ the same person sjccassively, ani 
not by different pers ms ’’praduiag each cult independently.

12 To blinding darkness go the men who make a cult of 

Nescience. 

The devotees of Science enter darkness that is darker 
still. 

13 Different is the fruit, they say, of Science and of Nesci* 

ence. 

1 hus from the sages have vi e heard who have declared 
this lore to us. 

14 The man who knoweth w«ll these two, Science and 

Nescience, combined,

endless life.

Paasinff death : that is, overcoming death in the shape of the 
absence of supernatural powers and of vice and desire by means 
of. the faculties obtained by the ^rorship of Hirauyagarbha 
( ver«e lo ) SambhiUi : here again meaning Asambhfiti or 
Undeveloped Nature. Endless life : that is, conditioned or 
limited immortality by absorption into Prakriti. 

1 2 Nescience : AvidyA, the opposite of Vidyfi or true Sceince; 
including ignorance of the real nature of the Atma and belief in 
the phenomenal and transient objective world. See Professor 
Majf Muller’s ThVee Lectures on the VedAnta Philosophy, 
pp. 97 — too. Here the word is u<;ed as equivalent to Karma 
(verse 2), one of its results, the constant performers of which, 
exclusively, fall into darkness which prevedts their knowing the 
truth. Science : VidyA ; meaning, here only knowledge of the 
DevatAs or Deities, not of the ParamAtmA or Supreme Self. 
This Science, alone, is insufficient. 

13 JHf event is the fmit : Science (knowledge of the Deities) 
leads a man after death to the Devaloka, the world of the Devas 
or Gods. Nescience, that is, Karm.4, kads to the Pitfiloka, the 
world of the Fathers, Manes or Ancestral Spirits. 

14 The person who practises the sacred rites and conjointly 

cultivates the Science of the Deities successively attains the fruits 
of both, obtaining, in the end, the union with the Gods called 
immortality in a limited spnse. * • 

15 This and the two succeeding verses are addressed to 
Brahma, the True, typifisd by Fire, and designated Om the 
Sacred Symbol of the Deity. Solar Fire, the Supreme 
Deity, and the self manifested in the Mind are here addressed

in identity by the dyin^' devotee, meditating upon the Supreme 
Light in the Sun as no other than his own Inner Light.^ The 
meaning of this verse is May my breath — the life-principle 
in me (called the Unyasarha, and consisting of the five organs 
of action, the five organs of sense, the five Airs, the Mind and 
the Intellect), leaving its bodily limitation, reach, or be united 
with, the immortal Hiranyagarbha or Sutratman, the Soul-thread, 
the Divine, all-pervading. Cosmic Life ; and may this grols b'ody 
consumed on the funeral pile end in ashes. JSy sphere : klibct 
which is not in the Kunva text, is explained by the Commen- 
tators as * the region allottee} to, or intended (kalpita) for, me’. . 

16 This verse, repeated from V. 36, and taken from R. V. I. 
89. 6. is a continuation of the dying devotee’s prayer. Goodly 
path : not by the path that leads to the abode of the Manes and 
subsequent transmigration, but by the fair road travelled by the 
Gods, on which there is no returning. To riches : that is, accord- 
ing to the Commentators, enjoyment of the reward of our Karma. 

17 Th>' Peal’s face : the face or real -form of that True 
Being — Bralima -the indwelling Spirit of all beings, animate or 
inanimate, — the Inward Ruler (antaryamin), the Purusha who 
dwells in the Sun yonder and in the body. In the K&nva recension 
a verse numbered 16 follows : O Nourisher, Sole Mover (or Sole 
Seer), Yama (Conti^oller), O Sun, Praja,pati’.s Son, remove thy 
rays and draw together or contract thy burning energv, so that 
I may behold thy most blessed Form. That Spirit (Purusha) 
who dwelleth in the Sun yonder, I am He (the immaterial eternal 
Soul). ‘ Thy most blessed Form ’ implies that True Spiritual 
Light which is, as it were, veiled by the golden orb of physical 
material light which typifies it. 

In both recensions, MAdhyandina and Ka^va, the order of 
verses i — 8 is the same. In the KAnva recension verse 9 corres-

Roar in Vol. of the Bibliotheca Indica ; by Professor Max 
Mailer in Vol. I of the Sacred Books of the East, and recently, 
together with the* Commentary of §ri Sankara, by S. Sitarama 
Sidtri, B. A. (published by V. C. Seshachari, B.A. B.L., through 
G. A. Natesan &*Co. Madras). I am indebted to my old pupil 
' and valued friend Babu PramadA DIksa Mitra of Benares, comple- 
ter of Dr. Ballantyne's translation of the Sahitya-darpa^a and 
author of an admirable English version of the Bhagavad Git&, 
for kind revision of my translation of, and notes on, this Upani- 
shad, and for many corrections and improvements therein. The 
following Excur'sus from this scholar's pen, mainly in defence 
and justification of the Commentator Sri Sankara, is, I think, a 
valuable addition to my annotations. 

Simple in language as this Upanishad is, it presents diffi- 
culties in the diape of apparently conflicting sentiments wbich it 
has taxed the ingenuity of ancient and modern commentators to 
reconcile ; yet a doubt sometimes arises whether the real sense 
has bden actually discovered. 

** This translation is generally in accordance with the Com- 
mentary of $rt Sahkaricharya who is followed by the great 
^jority of commentators and is recognized as the greatest 
XM W o ri t y on the Ved&nta Philosophy as expounded in its praathA- 
aafMftnya or triple course, rjiz the Upanishads, the Ved&nta 
Sfltias, and the Bhagavad-Git&. 

*'The chief paradox is contained in verse i z which declares 
that ignorance (avidy 4 ) leads to blind darkness, and knowledge 
(vidy 4 ) to darkness blinder still. '^ri Sankara explains vidy& to 
rrrftii -rf the inferior Deities and not the knowledge of 

the { M pow fe Brahma. For, according to him, the true knowledge 
of*tiM Supreme Brahma being th^ highest object of all religions 
duties and the sole end of the Upanisbhds, it cannot be said, 
under any arcumstances, to result in darkness. Whilst a 
knowledge of the Divinities and certain fbrms of their wosrship, 
also termed vidyi in the Upanishads, may bring a man into 
darkness or^n unhappy region if he n^lects the duties ordained 
by the §ruti and Smriti. fri Sankara, in all his Ved&ntic Com- 
mentaries, has urged repeatedly and forcibly that true knowledge 
of Brahma cannot be combined with Karma, for it removes the 
notion of duality and fills the devotee’s mind with an ever-abiding 
oopswusness of the Eternal Spirit, the Sole ReaUty. His 
mental and bodily act* are almost automatical, not being caused 
by any strong desire or passion. They are results of the rptidual 
avidyS the source of his present and last birth. Exceptio{|> is

made only in the case of Divine Incarnations and those who work 
solely for the good of the world without any, selfish motive 
or passion. 

'*The fourth Chapter of the third Book of the Ved&nta-Sfitras 
opens with the Sutra : ‘The end of map (is attained) by this 
(Ae independent knowledge of the Self ordained in the Ved&nta): 
such being the word of the Veda. So says B&dar&ya^a. In 
refuting the opponent’s arguments Sri ^ahkara explwns that 
verse 2 of this Upanishad refers to men in general and not 
specially to one who knows Brahma 1 III. 4. 13), hnd that even 
if it be conceded by virtue of the context that it refers to such a 
person it implies only a permission and not an injunction to per* 
form works, for the purpose of prwsing knowledge, as is shown 
by the words na karma lipyate nare, ‘work does not taint 
the n)an’. That is to say, even if a man who knows Brahma 
performs work as long as he lives it has no tainting effect upon 
him: such is the power of knowledge (111.4.14).! Thi^ dis- 
cussion about the connection of work with wisdom is concluded 
by explanations summed up in the following words; — ‘Knowledge, 
when produced, does not repuire anything else for the attainment 
of its fruit (salvation) : but fpr its production it does require (the 
help of sacrifices, etc). So says the Sruti; ‘Him (the Supteme Spirit) 
do the Brahmans desire to know by study of the Veda, bv sacri- 
fice, by gift, by austerities, and by fasting! (Corn, on Vedanta 
S. III. 4. 26). ‘Therefore, thus knowing, serene and self-subdued 
retiring (from the world) enduring (every pain) and self concen- 
trated, one sees the Self in his own self, (Biih. Up. VI. 4 33). 
‘Whereas the qualifications serenity, etc are directly connected with 
knowledge as is implied in the epithet evayi-vti, ‘thus knowing,’ 
they are the intimate or immediate (pratyfisanna) means of 
gaining knowledge ; whilst sacrifice, etc., being connected with 
the desire of knowledge, are its outward and remote means. 
Such is their distinction.’ (Ck)m. Ved. S.III.4.27) 

"It will be seen from the above that there is no 'inconsistency, 
as Professor Max Muller (Sacred Books of the East. Vol. I. p. 319) 
supposes in the explanations given by Sri Sankara of verse 2 in his 
Commentaries on this Upanishad and the Vedunta-Sutras. The 
Professor rightly remarks : 'Our Upanishad seems to have 
dreaded libertinism, knowledge without works, more even than 

t Vachaspati Misra says : ‘One only doing, eta, verse 2, 
refers to a person wbo has no knowledge. Even if it should refer 
• to, one who knows there would be no contradiction, glorification 
of* knowledge being intended.’ — Bh&matt, a gloss on Sankara, 
p. 675. S. 13. 

X Brihad&nyaka Upanisha^ IV. 4. 22. Fasting (an&^aka is 
expliun^ as moral fastkig, abstaining from sensual gratifications.

ritualism, works uutbout knowledge, and its true olqect was to 
show that orthodoxy and sacrifice, though useless in Aemselves, 
must always form the preparation lor higher enlightenment’. It 
would seem that it did not strike the Professor that §rl ^aiikara's 
contention is not that jyork should not precede the highest know- 
ledge, but that when it has been attained, there is no necessity 
for going back to the preparatory stage, seeing that the goal 
has already been reached for which the preparation was pre^ously 
undergone, ‘it cannot be too carefully borne in miud that this 
knowledge to which the great Sannyisi attaches so much value 
is not a verbal . or even a speculative knowledge of the Supreme 
Brahnui, which as the Professor justly fears, may lead to liberti- 
nism. Far from being the highest knowledge as understood 
by §ri ^aokara, the latter knowledge may indeed be lower than 
that of the Gods who are manifestations of Brahma as* Wind, 
Fire, Sun, etc. Brahma so manifested is worshipped in verses 
15 — 17 of our Upauishad. So Sankar&nanda, the preceptor 
of.^&yan&cnilrya, following as he does ^ri Sankara, adds an 
alternative explanation of vidyli in verse 12, viz. a knowledge of 
Brahma that lies only on the lip or in the mouth (mukbato 
Brahmavkdino va), and not in the actual realization of Brahma, 
shown m a life altogether free from desires and affections, doubts 
and fears, grief and delusion (see verse 7). Certainly it would 
be a contradiction to connect such knowledge with libertinism, 
and so after all Sri Sahkara must be pronounced to be right. 

«It may not be out of place to remark here that Sri ^a^ikara’s 
view of the relation of wisdom to work accords also with the 
teaching of the Bhagavad-Gitit which sets forth so prominently 
the’ importance of duty done unselfishly, vntbout expectation of 
reward. The Git 4 says : But the man who delighteth in Spirit 
(the Inner Self), is satisfied in Spirit, and js contented in Spirit 
alone, he (indeed) hath no work to do.” III., 17. 

*'I feel tempted to give here an interpretation of verse 12, being 
the expansion of an idea hinted at by a Pandit. It is not, however, 
found in any of the published Commentaries. It removes the 
apparent contradiction of the verse, and at the same time restores 
the force of iva rendered meaningless in all the other interpre- 
tations, and gives to vidyd its highest sense ; — 

* ‘Those who are devoted to knowledge (Ae highest knowledge 
of Brahma) enter into darkness, as if blinder still, i.e a darkness 
devoid of all forms and colours— of all this phenomenal world- 
darkness indeed as being beyond the light of the sun, the •moon 
the stars, fire and lightning, for the Sruti says : There the Sun 
ffhinoe not, nor the Moon, nor the Stars, nor do these lightnings 
e hi«e , far less does fire (K&tba Up. 5. 15). Sri Saftkara in his 
Anandalaharl, a hymn to the Primeval Power or Sakti, sings: 

*I adore the Supreme Simbhu, seatQ^ in tne lotus, named ljnl< 



37i TBt TSXTS or TSM [BOOX XI,

chakra, between the eyebrows (termed Avimukta or Kljl io the 
J 4 vila Upanishad), bearing the brilliance of a mwdred millions 
of suns and moons, united on one side with the ' Supreme Intelli* 
gence (Para Chit, the power of universal consciousness); whom 
to worship with devotion, man dwelleth /n the %htless bouse of 
his own Light, unapproached by the Sun and Moon and fire’ 
The fihagavad'Gita also gives expression to a similar idea when 
it says : ‘What is night to all creatioo'-therein wah;eth the self- 
concentrated’ (II. 69). Milton’s ‘Dark with excessive light’ might 
perhaps be explained in a like spiritual sense. 

“Lastly in favour of $ri Sankara it may be observed that he 
avoids the tautology which other Commentators make of verses 
ij—ii by explaining Sambbiiti and Asambhuti in the same sense 
almost as vidyi and avidy&.”
