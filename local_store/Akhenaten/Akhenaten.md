Akhenaten, S¯urya, and the R. gveda

A sad consequence of the colonialist historiography of the 19th century

Indologists is the comparative neglect of India’s interaction with Africa. Cyril

Indo-Africa

(1981) is the only book on the Indian contribution

to the history of sub-Saharan Africa that I am aware of, but it is just an

exploratory study.

The story of India’s interaction with Egypt is better

known, if only to scholars. Two important ﬁgures in this story are the Mi-

tanni king Tushratta and the New Kingdom pharaoh Akhenaten. But even

this encounter between the Indoaryan speaking Tushratta and the Egyptian

Pharaoh is not well understood although it was to have far-reaching impli-

cations for world history.

The Sun King Akhenaten of Egypt (ruled 1352-1336 BC according to the

mainstream view) was a son-in-law of Tushratta, the Mitanni king of North

tombs of the period, which have been discovered in excellent condition.

The Amarna age is one of the best-known and most romantic periods

of ancient Egypt. Akhenaten was revolutionary in his religious beliefs, and

many argue that his ideas mark the beginnings of the Western monotheistic

tradition. This period also saw the fabulously beautiful Nefertiti, Akhen-

aton’s ﬁrst queen who came from a mixed Mitanni family, palace intrigues,

artistic triumph and great personal tragedy.

In this essay, I shall investigate the question whether the worship of the

1

## Page 2

Sun introduced by Akhenaten might have had connections with the Indic

beliefs of the Mitannis.

Implications of this early encounter between the

Indic and the Western worlds will also be examined in view of the widely

accepted opinion amongst biblical scholars that Akhenaten’s beliefs were the

model for the later Jewish and Christian beliefs.

indicating that the famous hymn to Aten by Akhenaten which is seen as a

precursor to Psalm 104 of the Bible was inﬂuenced by the “Vedic” hymns

that were a part of the Mitanni heritage.

In view of the important role that biblical ideas have played in history,

the question of the relationship between Akhenaten’s monotheism and Vedic

ideas is of great signiﬁcance. It provides a lesson that the past consists of

unexpected complexity and that inﬂuences have ﬂowed in diﬀerent directions.

I am not suggesting that the encounter between India and West Asia was

one-sided; India must also have been changed in many ways.

The Mitanni

The Mitanni, who worshiped Vedic gods, were an Indic kingdom that had

bonds of marriage across several generations with the Egyptian 18th dynasty

to which Akhenaten belonged. The Mitanni were known to the Egyptians

as the Naharin (N’h’ryn’), connected to the river (nahar), very probably

referring to the Euphrates. At its peak, the Mitanni empire stretched from

Kirkuk (ancient Arrapkha) and the Zagros mountains in western Iran in the

east, through Assyria to the Mediterranean sea in the west. Its center was in

the region of the Khabur River, where its capital, Wassukkani was probably

located (Figure 1).

The ﬁrst Mitanni king was Sutarna I (good sun). He was followed by

Baratarna I (Paratarna, great sun), Para´suks.atra (ruler with axe), Saus-

tatar (Sauks.atra, son of Suks.atra, the good ruler), Paratarna II, Artad¯ama

(R. tadh¯aman, abiding in cosmic law), Sutarna II, Tushratta (Da´saratha), and

ﬁnally Matiwazza (Mativ¯aja, whose wealth is thought) during whose lifetime

the Mitanni state appears to have become a vassal to Assyria.

The early years of the Mitanni empire were occupied in the struggle with

Egypt for control of Syria. The greatest Mitanni king was Sauks.atra who

reigned during the time of Tuthmose III. He was said to have looted the

2

## Page 3

Assyrian palace at Ashur. Under the reign of Tuthmose IV, more friendly

relations were established between the Egyptians and the Mitanni.

The daughter of King Artad¯ama was married to Tuthmose IV, Akhen-

aten’s grandfather, and the daughter of Sutarna II (Gilukhipa) was married

to his father, Amenhotep III, the great builder of temples who ruled during

ks.ip¯a

1390-1352 BC (“khipa” of these names is the Sanskrit

, night). In his old

age, Amenhotep wrote to Tushratta many times wishing to marry his daugh-

ter, Tadukhipa. It appears that by the time she arrived Amenhotep III was

dead. Tadukhipa was now married to the new king Akhenaten, becoming

famous as the queen Kiya (short for Khipa).

The Egyptian kings had other wives as well. Akhenaten’s mother, Tiye,

was the daughter of Yuya, who was a Mitanni married to a Nubian.

It

appears that Nefertiti was the daughter of Tiye’s brother Ay, who was to

become king himself. The 18th dynasty had a liberal dose of Indic blood.

But how could an Indic kingdom be so far from India, near Egypt? A

plausible scenario is that after catastrophic earthquakes dried up the Saras-

vati river around 1900 BC, many groups of Indic people started moving

5

This idea of westward movement of Indic people is preserved in the

West.

Vedic and Pur¯an.ic texts.

We see Kassites, a somewhat shadowy aristocracy with Indic names and

worshiping S¯urya and the Maruts, in Western Iran about 1800 BC. They

captured power in Babylon in 1600 BC, which they were to rule for over

500 years. The Mitanni, another group that originated thus, ruled northern

Mesopotamia (including Syria) for about 300 years, starting 1600 BC, out

of their capital of Vasukh¯ani. (For Mitanni names, I give standard Sanskrit

spellings rather than the form that we ﬁnd in inscriptions in the inadequate

cuneiform script, such as Wassukkani for Vasukh¯ani, “a mine of wealth”.)

marya

Their warriors were called

In a treaty between the Hittites and the Mitanni, Indic deities Mitra,

Varun.a, Indra, and N¯asatya (A´svins) are invoked. A text by a Mitannian

very much like in India. It is not only the kings who had Sanskrit names;

3

## Page 4

a large number of other Sanskrit names have been unearthed in the records

from the area.

Documents and contract agreements in Syria mention a warrior caste

that constituted the elite in the cities. The ownership of land appears to

have been inalienable. Consequently, no documents on the selling of landed

property are to be found in the great archives of Akkadian documents and

letters discovered in Nuzi. The prohibition against selling landed property

was dodged with the stratagem of ”adopting” a willing buyer against an

appropriate sum of money.

Information of the mythology of the Hurrians of the Mitanni is known

from related Hittite and Ugaritic myths.

The king of the gods was the

weather god Teshub who had violently deposed Kumarbi paralleling the

killing of Vr.tra by Indra. Major sanctuaries of Teshub were located at Arrap-

kha (modern Kirkuk) and at Halab (modern Aleppo) in Syria. Like Indra,

Teshub also had a solar aspect. In the east his consort was the goddess of love

and war Shaushka (Venus), and in the west the goddess Hebat (Hepat). In

addition, a considerable importance was attributed to impersonal gods such

as heaven and earth as well as to deities of mountains and rivers. Temple

monuments of modest dimensions have been unearthed.

The general Indic inﬂuence in the area may also be seen in the comprehen-

siveness of the god lists. The most “oﬃcial” god list, in two Ugaritic copies

7

exactly as is true of the

and one Akkadian translation, consists of 33 items,

count of Vedic gods. These gods are categorized into three classes, some-

what like the three classes of the Vedic gods, although there are diﬀerence in

details.

Greek accounts tell us that the Ugaritic believed in a cosmic egg out of

which the earth emerged which is reminiscent of brahm¯an.n.a of the Vedic

view.

How do we know that the Mitanni were Indic and not Iranian? There are

several reasons, but to be brief, I shall only give three: 1. the deities Indra,

Mitra, Varun.a, and N¯asatya are Indian deities and not Iranian ones, because

in Iran Varun.a is unknown and Indra and N¯asatya appear as demons; 2. the

name Vasukh¯ani makes sense in Sanskrit as a “mine of wealth” whereas in

Iranian it means “good mine” which is much less likely; 3. satta, or sapta,

for seven, rather than the Iranian word hapta, where the initial ‘s’ has been

4

## Page 5

changed to ‘h’.

Why could not the Mitanni be the descendents of a pre-Vedic people

8

of the spread of the Indo-Iranian people from

as in the Gimbutas model

the Kurgan culture of the steppes of Central Asia? They would then have

had no particular aﬃnity for Indic deities. If the pre-Vedic people in Central

Asia already had Indin deities, how would these small bands of people impose

their culture and language over what was perhaps the most densely populated

region of the ancient world. Furthermore, that view does not square with our

knowledge of the astronomical tradition within India. The Vedic Sam. hit¯as

have very early astronomical and its geography is squarely within India. The

Ved¯a˙nga Jyotis.a, a late Vedic text, already belongs to the middle of the

second millennium BC. The earlier texts remember events within the Indic

theory of a proto-Indoaryan people in Iran from whom the Aryans of India

descended

The idea of invasion or large-scale immigration of outsiders into India

displacing the original population in the middle of the second millennium

BC has been rejected since it is not in accord with archaeological facts,

In a recent

12

, it was concluded that “there is no archaeological or biological

synthesis

evidence for invasions or mass migrations into the Indus Valley between the

end of the Harappan Phase, about 1900 BC and the beginning of the Early

Historic period around 600 BC.” Other scholars see no break in the cultural

tradition between 4500 BC and 600 BC.

The Indian textual tradition also does not permit us to accept the Gimbu-

tas model because of the length of time required for the rise of the voluminous

the Mah¯abh¯arata in one of his s¯utras (6.2.38). This means that the epic was

substantially complete by 500 BC, although it may have undergone further

modiﬁcations and interpolations in subsequent centuries. The evidence of

the s¯utra by P¯an.ini seems to have escaped most historians although V.S.

15

Agrawala did call attention to it decades ago.

The Mah¯abh¯arata tradition itself acknowledges that the text was origi-

nally 8,800 verses, composed by Kr.s.n.a Dvaip¯ayan.a Vy¯asa, when it was still

called Jaya. Later, it was enlarged to 24,000 verses and came to be called

5

## Page 6

Bh¯arata. It was transmitted by Vy¯asa to Vai´samp¯ayan.a and ﬁnally recited

by Ugra´sravas as the familiar Mah¯abh¯arata of the 100,000 verses; the two

latter bards appear thus to be responsible for its enlargements. Since the

enlargements of the Mah¯abh¯arata are likely to have stretched over several

centuries, it is unlikely that the text would not remember the migrations out

16

of Central Asia as is required in the Gimbutas model.

17

Furthermore, the astronomical references

related to the A´svamedha rite

in the Mah¯abh¯arata point to its extreme antiquity going back to the 4th

millennium BC, which cannot be squared with the Gimbutas model.

Indic Names in West Asia

Over ﬁfty years ago, Roger T. O’Callaghan and W.F. Albright published in

Analecta Orientalia

of Rome a list of 81 names (13 from the Mitanni, 23 from

the Nuzi, and 45 from the Syrian documents) with Indic etymologies. Out

of this list, Dumont provided the etymology of 45 names in the much more

Analyzing the names, Dumont concludes that the names are clearly Indic

and not Iranian. The initial

by the similar sounding

and not the Avestan

names are bahuvr¯ıhi or tatpurus.a compounds.

Dumont stresses its relationship to Sanskrit in the characteristic patronymic

names with the vr.ddhi-strengthening of the ﬁrst syllable, like in Saumati (the

son of Sumati) or Saus.apti (the son of Sus.apti). The worship of the Vedic

gods like Indra, V¯ayu, Svar, Soma, R. ta, Vasus has already been noted.

The fact the the Mitanni names suggest a Middle Indic dialect is support-

ive of the thesis that the emigration of the various groups from India took

place after the early Vedic period had come to an end.

Vedic Religion in West Asia

Our argument actually goes beyond the presence of people in West Asia

whose languages were Indic, as was the case with the Mitanni.

There is

evidence that Indic religion and culture had adherents even outside of groups

with Indic speech.

The Avesta speaks of the struggle between the worshipers of Ahura Mazd¯a

daevas

and the

. This opposition in the Zoroastrian texts is expressed as one

between the Mazdayasnas and the Da¯evayasnas. It is a conﬂict in which

da¯eva

Zoroaster wished to defeat and convert the worshipers of the

religion.

The Yaˇsts speak of legendary heroes and kings who participated in this strug-

gle. The wars against the Da¯evayasnas by Viˇst¯aspa (Yt. 5.109, 113; 9.30-31),

J¯am¯aspa (Yt. 5.68-70), and Vistaru of the Naotara family (Yt. 5.76-77) rep-

19

resent this ongoing conﬂict in the historical period.

In the Vendidad, the Zoroastrians are encouraged to take possession of the

da¯eva

lands, waters, and harvests of the

worshipers (Vd. 19.26). Elsewhere

(Vd. 7.36-40), it is recommended that the art of medicine should be ﬁrst tried

on the da¯eva-worshipers and if they survive then it should be attempted on

20

the Mazdayasnians.

8

## Page 9

Although the Zoroastrian heresy triumphed in Iran and the great Per-

sian kings of the middle of ﬁrst millennium BC followed the religion of

da¯eva

Ahura Mazd¯a, the

worshipers survived, especially in the West, in the

Mesopotamian religion.

Whether Zarathuˇstra belonged to the second millennium BC or later,

is clear that the Vedic gods survived for a pretty long time in corners of Iran.

The evidence of the survival of the Vedic gods from the

inscription of

Xerxes (ruled 486-465 BC). The revolt by the

worshipers in West Iran

is directly referred to:

Proclaims Xerxes the King: When I became king, there is among

these countries one which was in rebellion. Afterwards Ahura-

mazda bore me aid. By the favor of Ahuramazda I smote that

country and put it down in its place.

And among these countries there was a place where previously

time and in the proper manner. And there was other business

that had been done ill. That I made good. That which I did,

all I did by the favor of Ahuramazda. Ahuramazda bore me aid

until I completed the work.

The analysis of early Persian history has shown that the M¯azandar¯an, the

region south of the Caspian sea and the Alburz mountain range, remained

da¯eva

for long a centre of

worship. It has been suggested that the Xerxes

inscription refers to the suppression of these people.

da¯eva

Burrow takes the

worshiping people to be proto-Indoaryans and

sees them as the remnants of a population that stretched from West Asia to

India. The Iranians coming down from the northeast drove a wedge between

da¯eva

this belt, leading to the eventual assimilation of the western

worshipers

in the course of centuries.

Irrespective of what the original movement of the Indoaryans was before

the fourth or ﬁfth millennium BC, it is clear that since their Indian branch

recognizes the geography of only their region, it is either necessary to push

9

## Page 10

back the proto-Indoaryan phase to the fourth or the ﬁfth millennium BC or

to postulate their movement out of India as is suggested in the Pur¯an.as.

Akhenaten’s Rule

Akhenaten (“glory of the Aten”) ascended the throne as Amenhotep (“Amun

is content”) IV but he changed his name to honour Aten (“One god” repre-

sented as the solar disk) in his sixth regnal year. Aten is the deiﬁcation of

the disk of the sun god, Ra, who was also represented by the eye.

Akhenaten moved his capital from Thebes to Akhetaten (“Horizon of

Aten”), now known as Amarna, where palaces and buildings were built from

mud brick, and in which he built a splendid temple to Aten ﬁlled with reli-

gious art.

After his father’s death, he built temples on the perimeter of the famous

Temple of Amun at Karnak and dedicated them to Aten, rather than Amun

(“the Hidden One”, the principal deity at the time, also known as Amen).

He erased the names of other gods, particularly Amun, and he also erased

his father’s name wherever he found it.

Some argue that Akhenaten introduced monotheism by the banishment

of all deities excepting his chosen one. He has been seen as a precursor to

22

But it is

the Old Testament prophets, and thus to the Abrahamic religions.

equally plausible that he was inﬂuenced by the belief in “One Truth” behind

appearances of the Vedic system through the three generations of queens in

his family from the Mitannis.

The importance of the Vedic element appears to be reﬂected in the mys-

ticism of the Egyptian Book of the Dead (from 1600 BC on). Nevertheless,

the cult of the dead and resurrection remained the most important element

of the Egyptian religion. This cult continues to form the cornerstone of the

three Abrahamic faiths.

Akhenaten was succeeded by Smenkhkara, believed by some to be Ne-

fertiti herself, and soon afterwards by Tutankhaten, Akhenaten’s son by

Tadukhipa (Kiya) under the regentship of Ay.

Akhenaten was a fanatic

and the country had suﬀered a great deal during his reign. The nobles now

reversed course. Tutankhaten changed his name to Tutankhamen (to invoke

Amun), but before he could consolidate power he was dead at the age of

10

## Page 11

sixteen after a rule of just nine years. His tomb was discovered intact in

1922, and now he is widely known as the Boy-King.

Tutankhamen was followed by Ay, Nefertiti’s father, who ruled for four

years. He, in turn, was followed by the general Horemheb, who now erased

all records of Akhenaten, and his successors. The new city was abandoned,

and worship of the Amun was reestablished. Akhenaten’s disappeared from

Egyptian history, and he was referred to as “that heretic” or “rebel”, until

the reconstruction of the history in modern times. Yet, his idea of a jealous

god lived on, and prospered.

Letters, Religion, and the End of Tushratta

The context to the Amarna correspondence, in which there are letters be-

tween the Egyptian, Mitanni, and other neighbouring kings, is provided in

talling nearly 400, were written in a space of about thirty-ﬁve years from

about 1370 to 1335, from the end of the reign of Amenhotep III to the death

of Tutankhamen. The texts were written in a dialect known as Western Pe-

ripheral Akkadian which was the lingua franca of the Near East, though one

letter from Tushratta, is written in Hurrian.

Here is an extract from a letter by Tushratta to Amenhotep III, Akhen-

aten’s father: “My father loved you, and you loved my father still more.

And my father, because of his love, has given my sister to you... Behold,

one chariot, two horses, one male servant, out of the booty from the land of

Hatti I have sent you. And as a gift for my brother, ﬁve chariots and ﬁve

teams of horses I have sent you. And as a gift for Gilukhipa, my sister, one

set of gold pins, one set of gold earrings, one gold idol, and one container of

sweet oil I have sent her.” Another letter accompanies the image of goddess

is.t.a-dev¯ı

of Shaushka of Nineveh (Ishtar), Tushratta’s

, sent to Amenhotep

III to restore him to health during illness. Ishtar is Venus, and the Vena

24

hymn of the Rigveda (10.123) anticipates her Mesopotamian mythology.

A message of greetings from Tushratta to Akhenaten: “To Napkhuria

(Akhenaten), king of Egypt, my brother, my son-in-law, who loves me and

whom I love, thus speaks Tushratta, king of Mitanni, your father-in-law who

loves you, your brother. I am well. May you be well too. Your houses, Tiye

## Page 12

your mother, Lady of Egypt, Tadukhipa, my daughter, your wife, your other

wives, your sons, your noblemen, your chariots, your horses, your soldiers,

your country and everything belonging to you, may they all enjoy excellent

health.”

The Vedic presence via the Mitanni in Egypt and West Asia occurs several

centuries before the exodus of the Jews. This presence is sure to have left its

mark in various customs, traditions, and beliefs. Small Indic groups remained

in the general area for centuries after the disappearance of the Mitanni. Thus

Sargon defeats one Bagdatti of Uiˇsdiˇs in 716 BC. The name Bagdatti (Skt.

Bhagadatta) is Indic and cannot be Iranian because of the double ‘t’.

It may be that the continuing encounter between Indic and West Asian

groups explains some parallels in mythology and ritual, such as worship of

the goddess, circumambulation around a rock or the use of a rosary of 108

whereas they are remembered as commandments to be believed without un-

derstanding in the Western faiths.

This encounter was facilitated by the trade that continued between these

two regions of Asia. There is ample evidence for this trade during the Harap-

pan period and earlier. Harappan objects have been found in numerous places

in West Asia. Weights of the highly accurate Harappan system, which was

diﬀerent from the one in use in Mesopotamia, have been found in Dilmun

26

It is likely that such trade continued in the second and ﬁrst

in West Asia.

millennia BC.

In the Amarna Letters, the correspondents are from Egypt, Mitanni,

Babylonia, Hatti, and Assyria. Mitanni was also called Hanigalbat and Na-

harin; Babylonia is also named Karaduniyash or Shanhar; Hatti (of the Hit-

tites) was sometimes named after its capital of Hattusha. In the Letters,

Amenhotep III is called Mimmureya or Nimu’wareya or Nibmureya, while

Akhenaten is also called Naphurureya.

The Hittite king Suppiluliumas launched a surprise attack on the Mi-

tanni kingdom.

In the course of his victorious march, Mitanni began to

crumble and Tushratta was assassinated. His son ﬂed through various lands,

returning at long last to Vasukh¯ani as a vassal. Mitanni as an independent

kingdom ceased to exist. As the vassal of the Hittites, the rump state was

called Hanigalbat. Soon afterward, however, it was captured by the Assyrian

Hymn to the Aten

Your dawning is beautiful in the horizon of heaven,

O living Aten, creator of life!

When you set in the western horizon,

Earth falls into a deathly darkness.

People sleep in chambers, heads covered,

oblivious of the world,

the possessions in their head stolen.

Every lion comes forth from its den,

the serpents sting.

Darkness reigns, earth is silent,

as their maker rests in heavens.

Earth brightens when you rise in the horizon,

when you shine as Aten of daytime.

As you cast your rays,

the Two Lands are in festivity.

Awake, the people are on their feet.

Cleansed and clothed,

their arms adore your appearance.

The entire land sets out to work,

The beasts browse on their herbs,

trees and plants ﬂourish.

The birds ﬂy from their nests,

their wings greeting you,

as the sheep frisk on their feet,

and the insects ﬂutter.

All live when you dawn for them.

Boats travel north and south,

and roads lie open when you dawn.

The ﬁsh in the river leap up before you,

your rays are in the midst of the sea.

You are the one who makes the seed in men,

who feeds the son in the mother’s womb,

who soothes him that he may not weep,

a nurse even in the womb.

You give him breath when he is born,

you open his mouth in speech.

When the chick in the egg cries in the shell,

you give him breath to sustain him.

You have perfected him

to break out from the egg,

chirp and run around on his two feet.

Your works are manifold,

You make the heavens

to see your creation.

You make the beauty of form,

through yourself, alone.

You are in my heart,

there is no other who knows you.

Save your son, Akhenaten.

You have taught him your ways,

your might.

The world is in your hand,

you are duration,

beyond mere limbs.

Man lives by you,

and eyes look upon your beauty.

You established this world

for your Son,

who came from your body,

the King, the Lord of the Two Lands,

and Nefertiti, chief wife,

living and youthful forever.

The relationship of this hymn to Psalm 104 of the Old Testament becomes

striking when “Lord” of the King James version is changed into the proper

“Yahweh”. There is mention in both of the absolute power over the life of

animals and man, of the providing of natural bounties, and the responsibility

15

## Page 16

over personal destiny. It is also signiﬁcant that the Sun is also supposed to

be in the poet’s heart.

It should be remembered that Yahweh assimilated the characteristics and

epithets of previous gods of the region. For example, El was the chief god at

Ugarit. Yet El is also the name used in many of the Psalms for Yahweh.

In 2 Kings 22:19-22 we read of Yahweh meeting with his heavenly council.

The Ugaritic texts have a similar account, with the diﬀerence that the “sons

of god” are the sons of El.

Other deities worshipped at Ugarit were El

Shaddai, El Elyon, and El Berith.

Since all these names are applied to

Yahweh by the writers of the Old Testament, it means that the Hebrew

theologians assimilated the earlier mythology into their system.

Besides the chief god at Ugarit there were also lesser gods and goddesses.

The most important of these lesser gods were Baal, the goddess Asherah,

Yam (the god of the sea) and Mot (the god of death). It is interesting that

Yam and Mot are the Hebrew words for sea and death, respectively. It is

less well-known that Yam may be connected to the Vedic Yama who in RV

10.10.4 is seen as being born from the waters, and Mot to the Vedic Mr.tyu,

death.

We have mentioned the Vedic Yahv´ah. before; one may also note that Il.´a

´

represents Agni as in Yajurveda (VS) 2.3;

Il¯a represents Earth, speech, and

ﬂow. These parallels indicate a shared history and these names may have

entered the Ugaritic religion through the Mitannis.

The idea of the goddess was central to the West Asian people until the

end of the ﬁrst millennium BC. Asherah, a very important character in the

Old Testament, is called the wife of Baal, although she is also known as the

consort of Yahweh. Inscriptions found at Kuntillet ‘Ajrud (dated between

850 and 750 BC) say: “I bless you through Yahweh of Samaria, and through

his Asherah!”

And at ‘El Qom (from the same period) this inscription:

“Uriyahu, the king, has written this. Blessed be Uriyahu through Yahweh,

and his enemies have been conquered through Yahweh’s Asherah.”

The

Elephantine Papyri inform us that the Hebrews worshiped Asherah until

the 3rd century BC.

Baal’s name occurs frequently in the Old Testament.

Some Israelites

viewed Yahweh as a God of the desert and so when they arrived in Phoenicia

they thought it only proper to adopt Baal, the god of fertility. One of the

16

## Page 17

central Ugaritic myths was the story of Baal’s enthronement as king. In this

story, Baal is killed by Mot (in the Fall of the year) and he remains dead

until the Spring of the year. His victory over death was celebrated as his

enthronement over the other gods. The Old Testament also celebrates the

enthronement of Yahweh. As in the Ugaritic myth, the purpose of Yahweh’s

enthronement is to re-enact creation. That is, Yahweh overcomes death by

his recurring creative acts.

The major diﬀerence between the Ugaritic myth and the Biblical hymns

is that Yahweh’s kingship is eternal and uninterrupted while Baal’s is inter-

rupted every year by his death. Since Baal is the god of fertility the meaning

of this myth is quite easy to understand. He dies with the vegetation and he

is reborn with it. Christianity took an element from Baal’s death and made

it a singular event.

When one reads the Psalms and the Ugaritic texts one ﬁnds that Yahweh

is acclaimed for things previously associated with El. These Psalms appear to

have been originally Ugaritic or Phoenician hymns to El which were adopted

by the Jews. El is called the “father of men,” “creator,” and “creator of the

creation,” attributes also granted Yahweh by the Old Testament.

This discussion tells us how the hymns of the second millennium BC

became a part of the Old Testament and thus can be close the older texts in

style and form, even though the language may have changed.

Psalm 104, Old Testament

Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, thou art very great;

thou art clothed with honour and majesty.

Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest

out the heavens like a curtain:

Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh

the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the

wind:

Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a ﬂaming ﬁre:

17

## Page 18

Who laid the foundation of the earth, that it should not be re-

moved for ever.

Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters

stood above the mountains.

At thy rebuke they ﬂed; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted

away.

They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto

the place which thou hast founded for them.

Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they

turn not again to cover the earth.

He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the

hills.

They give drink to every beast of the ﬁeld: the wild asses quench

their thirst.

By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which

sing among the branches.

He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisﬁed

with the fruit of thy works.

He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the

service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his

face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man’s heart.

The trees of the Lord are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which

he hath planted;

Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the ﬁr trees

are her house.

The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for

the conies.

18

## Page 19

He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going

down.

Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of

the forest do creep forth.

The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from

God.

The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them

down in their dens.

Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.

O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made

them all: the earth is full of thy riches.

So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innu-

merable, both small and great beasts.

There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made

to play therein.

These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat

in due season.

That thou givest them they gather: that openest thine hand, they

are ﬁlled with good.

Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their

breath, they die, and return to their dust.

Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest

the face of the earth.

The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice

in his works.

He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills,

and they smoke.

I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my

God while I have my being.

19

## Page 20

My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the Lord.

Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked

by no more. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul. Praise ye the

Lord.

Scholars point to several similarities. Here, we list just a few. “When you

set in the western horizon. earth falls into a deathly darkness... Every lion

comes forth from its lair, the serpents sting.” (Hymn to Aten, stanzas 2-3).

“Thou makest darkness, that it is night; wherein all beasts of the forest do

creep forth. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from

god.” (Psalm 104: 20-21)

“Your works are manifold, though hidden from sight, O One God, beside

whom there is no other. You created the world as you wished, you alone.”

(Hymn to Aten) “O Yahweh, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast

thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.” (Psalm 104: 24)

Moses and Monotheism

In 1937, Freud published his essay,

, in the journal

29

Imago

proposing that the biblical ﬁgure of Moses was an Egyptian linked

to the court of Akhenaten. Freud provided much stimulating evidence to

support his argument, including the fact that the Jewish word for “Lord”,

“Adonai”, becomes “Aten” when its letters are written in Egyptian.

The other details of Freud’s reconstruction are disputed but they are

signiﬁcant for estimating the importance of the Egyptian ideas within the

Judeo-Christian tradition. According to Freud, Moses was a believer in the

monotheism associated with Aten, but with the death of Akhenaten the suc-

mose

cessor Pharaohs reverted to their old religion. Moses (from

, Egyptian

for “child”) now went to exile as the head of an oppressed Semitic tribe and

in order to set these people apart, he introduced the Egyptian custom of cir-

cumcision. His unruly followers killed Moses, and the tribesmen now adopted

the volcanic deity, Yahweh of another tribe, as their national god. Yahweh

was now endowed with the universal and spiritual qualities of the Moses’s

god, though the memory of Moses’s murder remained repressed amongst the

Jews, reemerging in a very disguised form with the rise of Christianity.

There is general agreement that Moses - who is said to have lived a

staggering 120 years - was a composite character created out of the faded

20

## Page 21

memories of a variety of diﬀerent individuals, some Hebrews, others Egyptian

in origin. The Egyptian component included the memory of Akhenaten’s

worship of the single god in the sky.

According to Freud, the death of Moses became central to the experience

30

of the Jews and it deﬁned the structure of Christianity as well. Says Freud:

“Original sin and salvation through sacriﬁcial death became the basis of the

new religion founded by Paul. After the Christian doctrine had brust the

conﬁnes of Judaism, it absorbed constituents from many other sources, re-

nounced many features of pure monotheism, and adopted in many particulars

the ritual of the other Mediterranean peoples. It was as if Egypt had come

to wreak her vengeance on the heirs of Ikhnaton [Akhenaten]. The way in

which the new religion came to terms with the ancient ambivalency in the

father-son relationship is noteworthy. Its main doctrine, to be sure, was the

reconciliation with God the Father, the expiation of the crime committed

against him; but the other side of the relationship manifested itself in the

Son, who had taken the guilt on his shoulders, becoming God himself beside

the Father and in truth in place of the Father.”

S¯urya in the Vedas

The Rigvedic hymns 1.50, 4.13, 10.37, all addressed to S¯urya provide fasci-

nating counterpoint and parallels to the Aten hymn and Psalm 104. These

parallels include viewing the Sun as superintending each creature’s welfare.

For example, RV 1.50.6 says: “You keep strict watch upon the man who

moves among the peoples.”

In contrast, the Atharvavedic Sun hymns of

Book 13 are strictly solar.

The eye of S¯urya is mentioned and he is himself called the eye of Mitra,

Varun.a and Agni as in RV 1.115.

Although, hymns to the Sun from independent sources can be expected

to have inevitable parallels relating to the motion in the sky and the warmth

that it oﬀers, the idea of the Sun superintending individual lives is surprising

enough to have had the same source.

It is also noteworthy that in the Vedic view the universe has a tripartite

division and the objective of human life is to reach the heaven, which is

equated with the Sun. The representation of the Sun is in the form of a disk.

21

## Page 22

Vedic Hymns to the Sun

For the sake of easy comparison, I reproduce RV 10.37 in R. Panikkar’s

31

translation.

Homage to the Eye of Mitra and Varun.a!

To the mighty God oﬀer this worship

to the farseeing emblem, born of the Gods.

Sing praise to the Sun, the oﬀspring of Heaven. [1]

May this word of Truth guard me on all sides,

while earth and heaven and days endure.

To its rest goes all else that moves, but never

do the waters cease ﬂowing or the sun rising. [2]

From ancient days no godless man

obstructs your path when you drive the winged sun-horse.

Your one dark side is turned eastward; with the other

the light-ﬁlled side, you arise, O Sun. [3]

By your light, O Sun, which scatters gloom,

by your rays which arouse the whole creation,

dispel from our hearts all languor, all neglect

of worship, all grief and evil dreams. [4]

Sent forth as an envoy upon your course,

you superintend each creature’s welfare,

rising with calm unvarying. May the Gods

grant us to achieve your goal today! [5]

This prayer of ours may Heaven and Earth,

the Waters, Indra, and the Maruts heed!

May we never be deprived of the Sun’s shining,

may we attain old age in happiness! [6]

22

## Page 23

Keen of mind and keen of sight,

free from sickness, free from sin,

rich in children, may we see you rise

as a friend, O Sun, till a long life’s end! [7]

O farseeing Sun, the bearer of Light,

the joy of every single eye,

may we live to see your glorious radiance

ﬂooding in as you ascend on high! [8]

You shine, all living things emerge.

You disappear, they go to rest.

Recognizing your innocence, O golden-haired Sun,

arise; let each day be better than the last. [9]

Bless us by your gaze, your brightness and shining.

Bless us in cold and in heat, O Sun,

grant us blessings at home and, when we are traveling,

bestow upon us your wonderful treasure. [10]

Protect both our species, two-legged and four-legged.

Both food and water for their needs supply.

May they with us increase in stature and strength.

Save us from hurt all our days, O Powers. [11]

Whatever grave oﬀense we have committed against you,

by our tongue, O God, or by carelessness of mind,

lay the burden of this sin on the one who plans evil,

on him, O Vasus, who wishes us ill. [12]

It is clear from this hymn that S¯urya is not only the outer Sun, but also

the source of life and warmth and the overseer of the individual’s personal

life. This latter conception is Sun as Lord who resides within the individual.

In the Vedic view, the inner Sun is ¯atman who is the same as Brahman, as in

ayam ¯atma brahma.

the Upanis.adic

The double reference to the inner Sun

23

## Page 24

is clear in R. gveda 1.50 where it is stated: “O Sun, maker of the Light, who

illumine all the radiant sky. You shine upon the host of Gods and likewise

on the race of men, that all may see the heavenly Light.”

The similarities between these three important compositions are striking.

The imagery has many parallels. The Lord or the Sun is not only a distant

object that provides light and warmth with ceaseless punctuality, it also rules

our individual destinies. The Sun is in the sky and also within the heart.

Another interesting R. gvedic hymn describing S¯urya is 7.63. Here it is in

32

the Griﬃth translation:

Common to all mankind, auspicious S¯urya, he who beholdeth all,

is mounting upward; The God, the eye of Varun.a and Mitra, who

rolled up darkness like a piece of leather. [1]

S¯urya’s great ensign, restless as the billow, that urgeth men to

action, is advancing: Onward he still would roll the wheel well-

rounded, which Etas.a, harnessed to the car-pole, moveth. [2]

Refulgent from the bosom of the Mornings, he in Whom singers

take delight ascendeth. This Savitar, God, is my chief joy and

pleasure, who breaketh not the universal statute. [3]

Golden, far-seeing, from the heaven he riseth: far is his goal, he

hasteth on resplendent. Men, verily, inspirited by S¯urya speed to

their aims and do the work assigned them. [4]

Where the immortals have prepared his pathway he ﬂieth through

the region like a falcon. With homage and oblations will we serve

you, O Mitra-Varun.a, when the Sun hath risen. [5]

Now Mitra, Varun.a, Aryaman vouchsafe us freedom and room,

for us and for our children. May we ﬁnd paths all fair and good

to travel. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings. [6]

24

## Page 25

¯

Some hymns to the

Adityas stress the conception of personal overlordship

even further. For example, AV 4.16 speaks thus:

The mighty overseer on high

espies our deeds, as if he were

quite close at hand.

The Gods through him know all men do.. [1]

...Two men may hatch a plot together;

Varun.a knows it all, being present

as the third one. [2]

Varun.a contains

within his body both the oceans,

and yet he also is contained

within one droplet. [3]

Seize and bind with a hundred cords,

O Varun.a, the one who utters falsehood...[7]

Varun.a is the warp of the loom,

Varun.a is the woof of the loom

of this universe.

Varun.a is of us, Varun.a is foreign,

Varun.a is divine, he is also human,

Varun.a the King. [8]

It is also notable that the Sun was represented as a golden disk (rukma)

with a golden image of the purus.a on it in the Agnicayana ritual which forms

a large part of the Yajurveda. This was the period when the Vedic religion

did not have monumental images of divinity.

It is not impossible that the poetic imagery associated with the Sun

in the S¯urya and the Aten hymns was conceived independently, but it is

unlikely. The idea of the Sun somehow appearing within the heart of the

individual is a revolutionary one, and since we do know of the presence of

a people (the Mitanni) who believed in the Vedic pantheon together with

its sophisticated understanding of the inner world, it is more likely that the

genetic relationship of the idea is as follows:

⇒

⇒

R. gvedic S¯urya

Aten

Yahweh of Psalm 104

25

## Page 26

We are not suggesting here that the R. gveda as it has come down to us

was carried to the West Asia by the Mitannis, although that cannot be ruled

out; rather that hymns with similar themes must have been a part of the

Mitanni culture as they went westwards from India. During this passage to

and sojourn in West Asia, their religion is bound to have been aﬀected by

the local beliefs. The worship of Ishtar points to a Babylonian gloss over

their original Vedic system.

It is clear that all aspects of the Vedic conception of S¯urya could not

r.ta

be a part of the idea of Aten. In the Indic view, cosmic law (

) and a

personal God are intertwined together through the mystery of sacriﬁce. In

the later ampliﬁcation of the Vedic ideas, Purus.a is apart and the unfolding

is a consequence of the law acting through Prakr.ti. In the Aten hymn the

idea of personal God is the predominant one although it is clear that the

cosmic law is also implied. The hymn appears perfectly consonant with the

conception of S¯urya. Nevertheless, from Akhenaten’s banishing of other gods

in his rule suggests that he was inspired by an incomplete idea.

It is possible that the parallels between S¯urya and Aten are entirely coin-

cidental due to the similarities between the Egyptian and Vedic conceptions

about the universe and divinity. The pre-Akhenaten religion had a spiritual

basis and the Egyptians formed several syncretisms between the sungod Re

and other gods, resulting in such names as Re-Harakhty, Amon-Re, Sebek-

Re, and Khnum-Re. The Vedic gods, being projections of the One Divinity,

also are combined together. But there was one distinct diﬀerence of em-

phasis between the Vedic system where the gods were more heard than seen

whereas in Egypt system their representation in images was the predominant

expression. If the seen was accorded the most signiﬁcance in Egypt; in India,

the heard (´sruti) was likewise supreme. The conceptions of paradise were

diﬀerent. In Egypt, the body was raised to it upon death; in India, the body

in paradise was a subtle golden body, unconnected to the life on earth. The

diﬀerence was, no doubt, due to a diﬀerence in the underlying cosmologies

of the two cultures. It was reﬂected in the diﬀerent funerary practices in the

two regions.

Given the matrimonial alliance across several generations between the

“Vedic” Mitanni (whose fondness for monumental representation of gods

must have been limited) and the Pharaohs, it is plausible that many elites

26

## Page 27

in the court had become favourable to the Mitanni religion. This is likely to

have made it possible for Akhenaten, early in his reign soon after his mar-

riage to the Mitanni princess Kiya, to declare his religion, which had much

similarity to the Mitanni.

This also explains why, after his death, the religion, being of foreign origin

and popular only with a minority, was suppressed violently and successfully.

Conclusions

There are important lessons to be drawn from the study of Akhenaten and

his hymn to Aten. Scholars see in Akhenaten the beginning of the Judaic

monotheistic tradition. Our examination of the facts shows that it might,

equally plausibly, be a retelling of the improperly understood ideas, or ideas

modiﬁed by the prevailing ones in their new land, in the journey to West Asia

by the Mitannis. We are basing our conclusions not only on the connection

to the Mitanni through Akhenaten’s wife but also on the pervasiveness of the

Vedic concepts in West Asia as in the notion of 33 gods, the use of the disk

to represent the sun exactly as is done in Vedic ritual, and the conception of

the sun who superintends personal destiny which is perhaps the central idea

of Vedic thought. We have also alluded to the similarity between the Vedic

Yahv´ah.

Yahweh

and the Hebrew

and between other gods. These parallels are

signﬁcant enough to demand a thorough investigation of the 2nd millennium

BC connections between India and the West.

The interaction between the Indic (Mitanni and other groups) and the

Egyptian and West Asian can help us in understanding the evolution of

the Western religions. It may also helps us understand the parallels between

´

Indic and Babylonian and Greek sciences. For example, if the early

Satapatha

Br¯ahman.a gives centrality to the number 432,000 (also the supposed number

of syllables in the R. gveda) then one can understand how this may have been

adopted by the Babylonians as a count for their Great Year. Both India and

Babylon divide the civil year into 360 equal parts. This is seen in India in

the R. gveda itself and in Babylon in the middle of the ﬁrst millennium BC.

Likewise, it may help us understand the Babylonian adoption of the idea of

tithi

of Indian astronomy which is mentioned in the R. gvedic Br¯ahman.as.

An interesting question related to the spectrum of religious belief rang-

27

## Page 28

ing from India to Egypt is the split between the Vedic and the Zoroastrian

religion. The Zarathustrian demonization of Indra and the N¯asatyas was a

rejection of the interiorization of divinity since Indra is the lord of the senses

and the N¯asatyas are the rulers of hearing. In the Vedic system elements

of materiality and divinity are in a hierarchical system: the physical body

(ruled by the Asura) comes ﬁrst and the spiritual body (ruled by Indra, the

33

senses) comes later which is why the Devas are younger to the Asuras.

Zarathuˇstra’s innovation was to create a system that was midway between

the Vedic with its emphasis on the spirit and the West Asian/Egyptian which

is body-centered (with its visions of being raised to life in one’s body in par-

adise). But the system brought in the devas through the backdoor as the

yazatas

yajata

(Skt.

).

It is also possible to see Zarathuˇstra as providing a synthesis in terms

of just two categories as was done in a diﬀerent way in the Pur¯an.as. The

Vedic view is to see the world in triple categories. Later Pur¯an.ic gloss simpli-

ﬁed this into dichotomies like that of deva versus asura (including r¯aks.asa).

Zarathuˇstra made a similar simpliﬁcation using the dichotomy of asura (in-

cluding deva under the label yazata) and daeva. The asuras are the ground

on which the devas emerge; likewise, without proper action one can slip into

the false path. The term daeva as a synonym for r¯aks.asa survives in Kashmir.

Within the Indo-Iranaian world, the memory of India’s interaction with

34

written in 1030, al-

Egypt persisted. In Chapter 48 of his book on India

B¯ır¯un¯ı, speaking of chariots of war, mentions the Greek claim that they were

the ﬁrst to use them and insists they are wrong because “they were already

invented by Aphrodisios the Hindu, when he ruled over Egypt, about 900

years after the deluge.” This reference cannot be taken to be literally true

but it is, nevertheless, signiﬁcant. It preserves the memory of a “Hindu”

(Indic-inspired) king of Egypt prior to the Greek state. The reference to the

chariots of war of this king (Akhenaten) seems to remember the foreigner

warlords Hyskos who ruled Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period

just before the New Kingdom to which Akhenaten belonged.

Aten (also spelled Aton) had a dogmatic name written within a royal

cartouche and including the three old solar deities, Re, Har, and Shu.

Re is the Egyptian sun god and creator god, usually depicted in human

form with a falcon head, crowned with the sun disk encircled by the

uraeus (a stylized representation of the sacred cobra). The sun itself

was taken to be either his body or his eye. He was said to traverse the

sky each day in a solar barque and pass through the underworld each

night on another solar barque to reappear in the east each morning.

Har (Horus) is the Egyptian sky god, usually depicted as a falcon or

in human form with the head of a falcon. The sun and the moon are

said to be his eyes. Son of Isis and the dead Osiris, he was born at

Khemmis in the Nile Delta, and Isis hid him in the papyrus marshes to

30

## Page 31

protect him against Seth, his father’s murderer. Shu is the primordial

Egyptian god of the air and supporter of the sky. In the Heliopolitan

creation myth, Shu was, with his sister Tefnut, one of the ﬁrst deities

created by the sun god Atum.

Horizon, in His Name as Shu Who Is in the Aton-disc, living forever

and ever; the living great Aton who is in jubilee, lord of all that the

in Akhet-Aton; (and praise of) the King of Upper and Lower Egypt,

who lives on truth, the Lord of the Two Lands: Nefer-kheperu-Re

Wa-en-Re; the Son of Re, who lives on truth, the Lord of Diadems:

Akh-en-Aton, long in his lifetime; (and praise of) the Chief Wife of

the King, his beloved, the Lady of the Two Lands: Nefer-neferu-Aton

Nefert-iti, living, healthy, and youthful forever and ever; (by) the Fan-
